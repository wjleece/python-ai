Doing some simple things to learn the OpenAI API:

* I built a simple program (OpenAI-API-analytics.py) to calculate ChatGPT token usage, response times, and some other interesting analytics. I did this primiarly to learn about the OpenAI API.
* I built a simple chatbot (ChatBot.py) to better understand how to create interactivity between a user and the ChatGPT assistant.
* Next I might enable the ChatBot to read certain Google Docs that it has been given access to so that it can provide advice taliored to the (non-public) information in those docs. This effort will take some time (it appears that I have to set up a website and a privacy statement for Google) so it's possible that I'll never do it. But if I do it will be kinda cool, espcially if it could read a lot of work-related documents and provide good answers to questoins. Or maybe find and bring attention to contraditions in certain documents...hmmm...this seems useful.
