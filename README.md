Doing some simple things to learn the OpenAI API:

* I built a simple program (OpenAI-API-analytics.py) to calculate ChatGPT token usage, response times, and some other interesting analytics. I did this primiarly to learn about the OpenAI API.
* I built a simple chatbot (ChatBot.py) to better understand how to create interactivity between a user and the ChatGPT assistant.
