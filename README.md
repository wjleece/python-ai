Doing some simple things to learn the OpenAI API:

* I built a simple program (OpenAI-API-analytics.py) to calculate ChatGPT token usage, response times, and some other interesting analytics. I did this primiarly to learn about the OpenAI API.
* I built a simple chatbot (ChatBot.py) to better understand how to create interactivity between a user and the ChatGPT assistant.
* Next I might enable the ChatBot to read certain Google Docs that it has been given access to so that it can provide advice taliored to the (non-public) information in those docs. This effort will take some time (it appears that I have to set up a website and a privacy statement for Google) so it's possible that I'll never do it. Also this would result in non-public information getting leaked to OpenAI, which means that this tool would be kind of dangerous if used in a corporate setting or if was used to scan personal health data.
