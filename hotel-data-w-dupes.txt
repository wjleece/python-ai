It would be a 3 star review if it were a 4 star $500 a night type place. But given the price point (we paid $1600/night for our room) and 5 star rating, I am giving it 2. There are much better options for the price point and 5 star category in this location, in my experience (have stayed in miami beach multiple times). 

To start with the positive: The services is really good/attentive, the grounds (not rooms) and restaurants are cool/flashy/sceney, and the pool/grounds are solid (not the best in miami). It is popular for the restaurants and cool designs on the grounds and well trained staff. However overall I think there are much better luxury options in miami beach / south beach for an actual stay, if you care more about quality of rooms/actual property, location, and pool. 

Issues: 1) the rooms are not that nice. We booked a junior king suite partial ocean view room for $1600/night. The room felt like 4 star vegas with no view. Low ceilings, bones and finishing quality mediocre, cool design touches but overall not 5 star room bones. 2) the hotel is right next to another taller / bigger building that is pretty close, so 95% of the view was blocked/looking directly at that building. We were on the north side which is where half the rooms of the type we booked are, maybe the other side is better. We didnt feel like we were on the beach despite the price and description of the room, you could not see ocean unless standing at an extreme angle to the window. We asked for an upgrade because we thought the description was misleading; we were told this was normal / how the rooms were, and would have to pay significantly more to upgrade. 3) location: it isnt that close to nice restaurants other than the ones at the hotel, which are good, but there isnt much to do around the actual hotel. Options are stay on the grounds or get a 20 minute uber. Not walkable. 

Overall I would go here for dinner / drinks and stay somewhere else. One hotel (better all around, most similar from a luxury standpoint but better luxury IMO), Standard (better vibe, better pool, not as luxury, but cooler, and better location), and fountainebleau (better resort-like if that is what you want, faena is kind of resort like) are all better options in my experience. All have better views/pool, and the One and Standard are notably better locations (especially the standard; One is closer / more walkable. The FB is even further/worse location but if you dont want to leave it is better than Faena).  I think Faena gets the strong reviews more from the service (which is great and which does make people want to reciprocate with a good review) and the restaurants (they are cool but you dont need to stay here to eat here). And the unique designs/art. But actual rooms, views, location all mediocre, pool etc. fine but not standout. ",Overrated. There are better luxury options on miami beach / south beach

But after the superlative reviews and at a rather breathtaking price, I honestly was expecting something perfect.  

The pluses: the staff, the staff, the staff.  Kind and genuinely wanting to be helpful.  Also the spa - exquisite and great treatment.   The decor is as special as you would expect from the pictures you have seen.  

The minuses: my room (415) was billed as an ocean view junior suite.  However, the ocean view from such a low floor isn’t much - and the room, right on top of the spa, looks much more directly onto an events/dining area - sitting on the balcony didn’t feel private or restful at all.  While some junior suites have desk areas, this one did not - a shame as I had to work.  I asked about moving but they were undersndably fully booked.  Of course no Virtuoso upgrade available. Also, there was a crib in my room ( not requested by me) when I checked in. I asked before dinner and after dinner to have it removed. After I got tired of waiting for someone to come to get it I just moved it into the hallway myself. Not a big deal but not perfect service either.  These things aren’t tragedies but at more than 2700/night w fees and taxes ….. you do want better. 

Minor quibbles with the room had to do with electricity: the outlet for the coffee maker was broken and although engineering was called, it wasn’t fixed. And the light switches could drive you crazy trying to get the lights to actually turn off.  Japanese toilet is a great touch though.

Food and beverage; dinner at Los Fuegos and breakfast were great service.   Nothing that memorable food wise but nothing was bad either.   The steak at Los Fuegos was good but the appetizer was bland - same w breakfast dishes.  The pool and beach food service is great but the food not that exciting. Go to the pool early if you want an umbrella. By 11:30 AM you could still get a lounger, but nothing shaded.

I will probably come back because of the service. I think I will book a lower room category that is less expensive , so I am less disappointed!",Very good  but not perfect

Raul Diaz a Reservation's Specialist was so kind and caring, took the time to coordinate every details with me and in a carefully detailed email outlined everything that we had discussed. I contacted Raul several times to make minor changes and every time, including bringing family pet and he was beyond kind, responsive and professional. He really understood that this was a special occasion for us as a family and never gave the impression that I was taking too much of his time. The five stars got to Raul for making us feel special and tending to our every need.  We all are beyond excited for this experience.  Thank again to Raul !

Hotel is right on the beach and is how you would expect a  ‘cool’ Miami Beach hotel to be. “in” crowd, Art Deco type building, swanky interior (which may or may not be your taste).

Staff was friendly, beach nice, room spacious and clean. Food was very nice throughout the hotel.

Also would like to point out that they have a nice outdoor bar area for pre dinner drinks and an a busy indoor bar for later boasting live music - really a great plus.

Minor cons: 
- some of the room features & furnitures soemwhat dated (eg scratches, dents, spots) even though room was very clean.
- valet can be soemwhat disorganized so plan in advance if you need your car urgently

All in all a good experience, would not mind staying here again but also might check out another place next time round.",“Cool” Miami Beach Hotel

Maybe it was because there was a massive boat show in town. Either way, we got suckered into paying $2,500/night for three nights at the Faena, so we we expected opulence.  What we got was a ripoff at a $400/night hotel. 
The location is excellent, right on a private beach. That’s the only positive of this review. Here’s the abundant negatives:
* it was a windy day at the beach, so we asked for a canopy. We were told they were all reserved. There were only six of them. For an entire hotel. So we instead sat on the windy beach and enjoyed a $20 pina colada in a pre-packaged coconut.
* so we went to the pool. You can’t just sit down, they find you a seat. But we were told all the lounges were reserved, even the empty ones that go with the cabanas, and the cabanas were all reserved. Come back in an hour, we were told.
* our room, which was exceedingly average, smelled like mildew. They sent housekeeping with some sprays. The room was also quite dark, and the lights didn’t go up any higher.
* as for Miami Beach, it’s nice. There’s a long walkway that I went on for a mile or so, seeing where it led. Turns out it didn’t lead anywhere. There’s not much to do here other than beach and restaurants. 
* there’s some fun art, including gold wooly mammoth bones. But the glass case is cracked, and, like the rest of this hotel, the display seems old and neglected.
And that, dear reader, all happened within 24 hours. Because after the pool fiasco, we up and left the Faena for greener pastures — the reliable Four Seasons in the Brickell section of Miami, which was wonderful (see my review of that wonderful hotel for details). The Faena was nice enough to cancel our second and third nights, and we paid less than half at a way better hotel. Do yourself a favor. Skip this aging monolith.",BEWARE: Do not overpay!

I didn’t find a cronut but I found this amazingly energetic, fun, charismatic Brazilian gem named Lilia who topped my great experience at the Cafe.

Her positive  outburst of energy made for an unforgettable experience and while taking care of me she made sure other gusts were being helped as well, Lilia is a true star engaging hospitality, making us feel welcome creating that emotional connection that will bring me back to1hotel even if just for another cup of coffee and a pastry and a first class experience when I’m back in town on another short trip, possibly to experience the Hotel as well.

Once I reached the door, complete with a doorman opening the door for me, things changed.  The interior of the building, lobby to rooms, is luxurious.  The finishings are thoughtful and classy.  Location is great, right at the heart of everything I wanted to see/do, and less than two blocks from the transit stop to get me to and from the airport.  Internet was acceptable and the TV was massive.  There were a number of pillow choices and the plugs were high on the wall – so you were less likely to forget your charging cord.  I also loved the room safe, which was large enough for both my camera and laptop.  This is not typical.  I had only one picky thing with the room – there is no shelf in the bathroom.  I’m a girl.  I really need a shelf for “stuff”.  I did appreciate the box of Kleenex near the bed.  This is one of those nice things often overlooked these days.  I had two major issues, however, not specifically related to the room condition.  One was about the reservation.  I specifically asked for a “quiet” room and hotel staff responded that this was fine.  I was given the room right next to reception.  Not quiet!  That being said, this is an old-construction building with thick walls and a Miami air conditioner chugging along with lots of white noise, so I muddled through with my earplugs.  (I was also really, really tired, which helped with the falling asleep).  My other concern isn’t so much with the Kent Hotel, but the practice of adding a surprise “resort fee”.  I had made the reservation a good bit in advance.  Why was I never told that there would be a little something extra?  And for what?  The hotel is nice, but there is no pool, no gym, no reserved seats/umbrellas on the beach, no free breakfast, and, unlike the last hotel where I ~~didn’t~~ have to pay a resort fee, no free kayaks or inner tubes to use.  The staff, who were very friendly, clearly felt bad about this and were quite apologetic.  The receptionist offered up a beach towel if I wanted one (I didn’t, but she looked so sorry …)  She said that the resort fee was a state tax.  Sorry Kent, and all the other hotels.  This sounds more like a “you” problem rather than a “me” problem.  At the very least, let us know about these fees ahead of time instead of playing gotcha.  And please, don’t charge me extra money at the last minute to use a towel.  Which I didn’t even use.  Bottom line.  Would I book here again?  Maybe.  I paid a deeply discounted rate due to reward points.  If I had to pay full price, no.  If I could pay the same rate I actually paid, then yes, probably.",A Mixed Bag

My travels often cause multiple last minute schedule changes and hotels are not Always receptive to assist (packing up and moving down the hall or across the street is a nightmare when your trip is focused on business meetings, tradeshow schedules and international conference calls!).     
However, Ros (GM) and Eddie (Sales Manager) could not have been more generous with their time and attentiuon to detail.  They assisted with my schedule changes, my special room requests and even made certyain that my terrible Down Allergies were mitigated by additional room ckeaning/and bedding management.  I am SO happy with their kindness and comittment to provide TOP QUALITY and PERSONAL Services at their hotel in Miami.  THANK YOU is simply not enough,

The food (and cocktails) at the Strawberry restaurant were very good, and the coffee is super good too (at the coffee station).
It was always very cleen everywhere (room, swimming pool,etc ).
The persons at the service were nice and helpful. I find the overall vibe cheerful!

Check in was smooth and we found our way around easily, having just stepped off a Cruise we were in need of a coffee and a sit down which was very pleasant.
Once at the pool we lay on some Beds(as in double beds) very comfortable and found the Pool area very stylish, pretty and tasteful. 
However at 11.45am we were asked did we wish to stay on these beds as they were chargeable(which we didn't  realise) starting at $500 then $400 then $300 !!! OR move over to the seats behind which are free???? I am well travelled but have never come across this ever anywhere before so it come as a complete surprise to us. 
Anyway we chose not to pay as it seemed rather steep having already paid for our stay we thought it ridiculous as there are nowhere near enough sunbeds or seats for the amount of rooms at this Hotel, but that's how it is apparently !!
Our stay was good rooms are adequate, though rather small. Bathrooms are roomy and tastefully decorated. Clarke needs a mention who works on the front desk, he was a Gem and really helpful and a really good fella.
Would we stay again - doubtful !! The place is beautiful but pretentious and i think rather expensive for Room Only.  (very pretty though and beautiful Towels that match the décor)",Goodtime was Good

By morning we were “sliving” on Sunday at the rooftop pool and snapped photos posing under the palmbrellas leaving our social media friends and family “jelly”.
As the sunset, we sat comfortably on the patio of Strawberry Moon for a casually elegant dinner. Veronika was our server, she was playfully attentive and made excellent recommendations regarding food and drink pairings.

At lunch, no charge hot popovers are the bread basket.  Seriously, like being in Paris.

We were immediately impressed and welcomed by the gorgeous lobby and lounge area (just like the photos!), and friendly hotel staff, who greeted us with champagne and beverages for our children. We enjoyed the ambiance - the bar, delicious scents, calming music, comforting decor.   We arrived early - much before check-in time, but no problem - our luggage was tucked away while we went up to the rooftop pool.  This was a treat!  The pool was well staffed, had a great menu and a nice vibe… great play list, which ties in with the nostalgic rock n’ roll photos that grace the hotel walls.  The pool vibe is distinctly different, yet complimentary to that of the library area, where classical music, often opera is piped in. The blue velvet sofa was my favorite place to read.  Every morning at 7:30, I joined the rooftop yoga class, with its beautiful views of the sun rising, followed by a coffee at the Starbucks across the street and a walk on the beach!  Glorious!

When it came to meals, the Betsy did not disappoint!  We had breakfast and dinner on the front patio and several lunches at the pool.  The prices were a little on the high side but the portions were large.  

Fritzner at the front desk was incredibly attentive and accommodating, and went the extra mile to ensure that we had a great stay.  Art, the concierge is a true gem of this hotel, and his restaurant recommendations were absolutely spot on!!  Juan, the bellman was the first to greet us, helping us with our luggage and making us feel welcome. 

The only elements that prevented me from rating this as 5 stars was our room - a 2-double bed suite with a pull-out sofa.  It was nicely decorated with green leafy wallpaper, cute, comfortable beds, and a sitting area, but the view left something to be desired.  

Overall, we had a fabulous time, at this well-appointed, friendly, art-filled, beautiful boutique hotel.",Lovely Hotel

The location is great and close to walking to many things including the beach, other hotels, restaurants, coffee/sandwich places and also the free trolley stop. Olga was amazing. She is very professional and attentive to our needs. Always willing to help and make sure we are having a good time. Olga really made out stay a nice one. The hotel pizza place is very good as well. It was nice to be able to eat at the hotel after a long day at the beach if we wanted to. Unfortunately, breakfast was something to be desired. The person that staffs the breakfast didn't speak any english so hotel guests were unable to communicate when things were out and/or ask if they had certain items. Several hotel guests were visibly frustrated with this and I could see didn't enjoy the breakfast. It would be nice if they had more healthy items for breakfast and more fruit options and even a egg white option. Breakfast needs improvement. on the flip side there are some nice places close by that offer breakfast and coffee if you prefer to go elsewhere. Another major thing that was great is that they clean the rooms everyday! We really enjoyed having our rooms freshened! thank you for a great stay!",Great vacation!

Room was very small, only space for the bed and a desk with chair. 

Our bathroom door was a barn-style door and kept jamming on us. We asked the front desk to send someone to fix it and it never happened during our 3 days there. They said later on that they tried to call me to ask if we would move to another room so they could fix the door, but I'm a Hilton Gold member and know my phone number is up to date and I had zero missed calls.

The hotel was built in 1945 and was one of last Art Deco buildings built.  The manager of the hotel graciously shared the hotel's history with us.  Everyone at the hotel was helpful, pleasant and gracious.  The hotel is impeccably clean with outstanding soundproofing.  The rooms are somewhat small but in keeping with hotel's built in the 40's.

It’s perfectly located, stylish and cleverly furnished to immerse you in that glamorous period feel. 
When we checked in this time , we noted it had had a level of refurbishment but, thankfully, it was still sympathetic with its period. So far so good. 
Our room was comfortable (great bed) with period furniture, smart TV and quirky bathroom. Impressively, the rooms to the rear of the hotel were surprisingly quiet at night - despite it being Spring Break. 
One disappointment though was the lack of hospitality. Previously, staff had always been welcoming, this time this was lacking. As a guest, your ‘resort fee’ covers a complimentary cocktail each day and beach loungers (not the umbrella though). You also get 20% off food and drinks. The same waiter served us three times and never applied the discount until reminded. The restaurant was always quiet as well (everywhere else full). Prices were high compared to some - and there’s lots of competition. 
Practically speaking, you have restaurants immediately to both sides of the hotel. There’s a CVS nearby and plenty of coffee shops etc. Parking is valet only, but was very convenient. Bear in mind, Ocean Drive is one way only now so you have to drive down from N to S. 
Overall, a good hotel in a great location. Perfect for getting the full SOBE experience. Just a shame the staff couldn’t crack a smile and be more welcoming.",One of the best in the Art Deco area but could do better.

The hotel, in part because of the staff but also because of the Deisel design, has a very European (Italian, specifically) feel to it.  I would definitely stay again.  Close to many bike rentals and staff had excellent recommendations for local restaurants (in addition to their own). And, of course, the beach is across the street.

""Amenty fee"" ($47) is a bit annoying, but par for the course in Florida - this one comes with some sparking water and sodas in the fridge along with a beach chair during the day and a beach towel.

It was my 4th time in Miami Beach, but definitely Pelican Hotel is the best hotel I stayed in. Pelican Hotel is a super classy place, though not snobbish or obsequious. Owners as well as all the employees are extremely kind and helpful and I would absolutely say a special thank you to Anthony, the receptionist. 

Services included are amazing and it does not take long until you feel a special guest : free towels for the beach, spot on the beach where you can get a sunbed, the room being checked in the evening and a card with the weather forecast put on the bed with a little something. That may sound stupid but it makes a difference and I would like to say a warm thank you to everyone there who made my son and I feel so good during our one-week stay. 

Finally let me highlight that food is amazing and breakfast is a must. If I come back to Miami it will definitely be in Pelican Hotel.","Amazing Art Deco hotel, completely renewed whilst keeping all the art deco codes and best location in South Beach."

The 2 guys on reception were friendly and very attentive and we were lucky enough to get upgraded to a suite (Executive thirties) a huge space overlooking the drive itself.
Everything was spotless, and comfortable. The bathroom was amazing and the toiletries were upmarket and beautifully scented (I think we used everything!).
We ate our evening meal and breakfast the next morning sitting on the balcony overlooking the drive. We felt like we were on a film set.
The Pelican is not cheap but we felt that it was great value for the experience.
We had such an amazing time that we returned for brunch on the day we were due to fly home. It did not disappoint and was a fantastic end to our holiday.
We will definitely return!

The Standard delivered an excellent experience on all fronts. I booked a Medium Bath Terrace room, which was well appointed and the terrace soaking tub was fun. The pool area is a star attraction (Craig and Preston are super friendly and attentive waiters if you're looking for snacks and beverages! Shout out to the happy hour special - swordfish kebab was delicious). Gorgeous views of the Miami skyline, spacious infinity pool, a plunge pool, and a fabulous hot tub with waterfall - I spent most of my time in the pool area! I enjoyed all food/beverage offerings: the Lido had consistently yummy foods especially salads and seafood (John was a terrific waiter!), The Monterrey had lovely cocktails and vibes, and the coffee at the cafe was strong and surprisingly inexpensive. The spa was AWESOME with highly attentive and accommodating staff. The vibes reminded me of my regular spa back home, Great Jones Spa. I got the KISS body treatment, the Standard facial, the Detox Cleanse, and the Standard massage and all were excellent and sorely needed me time. I'd love to particularly recommend Cristina, who performed my Standard massage. She went above and beyond in her treatment and my neck and shoulders haven't felt this good since I was probably in my early 20s! Seek her out and explain what ails you, she will fix it. I will definitely come back and make this a regular recharge destination.",Wonderful experience start to finish

I've been doing this for 6 years and this year I went to the Standard. While the Hotel is a little different than most, I have to say that the Spa is the BEST I have ever visited. The variety of treatment options and services is impressive. I especially enjoyed the heated marbles and scrub rooms. The staff are completely attentive and helpful. They get A++ for good service.  The pool area has a hot tub with a waterfall that is very enjoyable. 

The Hotel itself has a very different vibe than most; it's not like a Marriott or Hilton. I think the target clients are well-oiled bikini-clad millennials who enjoy Yoga and such. Never saw so many string bikinis in my life!  As a 73-year old granny I was a little out of place. But everyone was very kind to me. The rooms are very small with no real work space. No coffee service in the room. Folks who needed to work on their PCs were sitting out in the garden. The restaurants and cafe serve up a host of healthy options, like vegan waffles and lemon grass smoothies -- no biscuits and gravy here. 

One other positive about this resort is it's pet-friendly. A host of goldendoodles and labradoodles wandered the pool area -- all very well behaved. Very friendly indeed!",Truly World Class Spa

This review is specifically for Lori Bell AKA ""The Good Witch"" who works at the The Standard Spa. For the past year I've seen Lori regularly for acupuncture appointments to help with a specific illness I have. 

Lori is truly a gifted healer. She makes me feel safe and cared for. Prior to seeing Lori, I only had acupuncture one time with another practitioner; Lori explained everything to me and is exceedingly gentle. I know that Lori is always looking out for my best interest. Each session she goes above and beyond. She's helped me secure specific Chinese herbs to help with my healing process. She's reviewed my astrological chart and provided readings. One time when I forgot to bring my wallet to the spa, she even offered to spot me for the session. The way she goes above and beyond for her clients is unparalleled. I'm healthier now, in huge part, because of Lori.

On top of all of this, I think Lori is the coolest person who lives in Miami. She's super empathetic, knowledgeable about all kinds of non-traditional medicine, and incredibly stylish. I love reading her monthly horoscopes on The Standard's website. Book an appointment with her ASAP. You won't regret it. ",Lori Bell AKA The Good Witch at The Standard Spa

I ended up checking into the hotel after midnight, after an Airbnb rental turned out to be a scam.  I showed up with my luggage and my two daughters, in the lobby, hoping for a room. Even though the hotel was over 95% capacity because of a wedding, the front desk was able to find me a room that night. The next morning I spoke with Oscar Melody, from the hotel and he upgraded the room that we were in and extended our stay.  The staff could not have been kinder and they made a very stressful situation a lot better.  The rooms are clean and we felt safe and were able to turn a disaster into a good time.

I decided to book Nautilus as I have been there before and I had an excellent experience. This trip however, was the totally opposite experience.

First thing, I get to the hotel and the bellboy doesn't even open the door for me and my girlfriend. Not even an hello LOL. I found that extremely rude and a terrible first impression.

I booked my room through booking.com and booked the King Balcony Oceanfront room. When I get to the hotel, the front desk clerk tells me there was an error and that my Oceanfront balcony room was not available and they could not honor the room that I booked but instead they would put me in a equal value room called the Oceanfront King. This room has an ocean view but no balcony and it is a little bigger than the room that I booked. I did not want this room and I insisted that I get the room that I PAID FOR! If I wanted a window room, I would've just gotten the cheapest room. After about 15 minutes of him typing in some stuff, he goes to the back to speak to his ""manager"" and he came back to tell me that the room I booked will be available the next day. Almost as if I didn't complain they wouldn't have gave me the balcony room. Still pretty upset that they didn't tell me prior to my arrival and the room was booked 3 weeks in advance. I agreed to stay in the room they provided for one night.

The next morning around 10 am, I texted the front desk to see if my room was available and they told me that the room would be available at 3pm. They told me that they can move our belongings for us if we decided to go out but from the way things were being handled already, I didn't feel comfortable leaving my possessions in their hands. So we canceled our lunch plans and stayed at the hotel beach. Paid $160 for a beach bed, I don't understand why there is a charge for this but I guess this is how they make their money? At 3pm, I get notified that the room is ready. I go to the front desk and they give me the keys to my new room. The front desk clerk asks the bell boy to open the old room door for me because the keys to the old room no longer works. The bell boy comes up with me and leaves me to carry 5 bags by myself. It was really unbelievable!!!!

After all this, I decided to stay away from the hotel activities for the remainder of the trip. The day we check out, I asked to see an itemized list of the purchases I made, beach bed, lunch at the hotel restaurant, drinks at the pool and drinks on the beach. That was supposed to be everything as far as the charges go but then I noticed a bunch of charges from the minibar. I do admit that I removed some of the items in the mini fridge to make room for some of the things I purchased from CVS but everything I removed was carefully placed on the side of the minibar. They claim that there is a sensor on the items but it did not explain the cashews and M&M's that were charged not even near the refrigerator. After explaining to the front desk clerk that those were not my charges, he gave me a look as if he was saying"" are you sure"" type of look. He then goes to management again and they remove all the charges.

I don't like being embarrassed in front of other hotel patrons and this is exactly what happened to me twice! First, I have to plea my case that I should have a balcony room that I paid for when it should have never even gotten to that point. As I check out, I am pleading my case, making me feel like I am some sort of criminal. I would have happily paid for the things I used or consumed but this was not the case. If I am spending close to 600 a night for a room I think I should be able to afford a few overcharged M&Ms and Cashews. 

Overall, this hotel is not the same hotel I went to 6 years ago. The only good about this hotel was the nice smell in the lobby and the beach attendee Issac. Everything else was extremely subpar for the price you pay to stay here. I would recommend going somewhere else for this price.",2nd times not a charm

Oscar, Lana, Arianna, Melody, Tea, Giuliano, and Jackie take pride in this retro boutique hotel and provided world-class service.

ROOM: We booked a King Ocean Front with a pullout sofa bed. It was fantastic… and HUGE. The bathroom was massive (especially for South Beach). The minibar was epically stocked and there was an espresso machine too! We watched the glorious sunset and sunrise from our huge window. It was so quiet I thought maybe no one was on either side of us, until I saw our neighbors the next morning heading to the rooftop terrace with coffee. The rooftop terrace was incredible! Oscar even made sure we knew how to access the terrace!

POOL: The pool was top-notch. The water was the perfect temperature, crystal clear, not crowded, tranquil, quality guests and very polished staff. I love that they have a delightful young man dedicated to escorting you to available padded loungers. I’m sure this would be especially helpful at times when it’s near capacity - no awkward weaving through the chairs and scooting them around to fit your group. 

CABANA: We were so fortunate to have a cabana our first day, as we wanted to heal our sunburns from our cruise. Svetlana took excellent care of us and anticipated our every need. The cabana had a large cushioned couch, cushioned ottoman, coffee table, SMEG mini fridge, standing retro cooler, fan, large TV, towels, storage, and a super rad orange safe. The piña coladas were boozy and not too sugary. Pro-tip: go with a double. Lunch review below…

BEACH: Direct, easy access. The private beach is steps from the hotel - just stroll through the bamboo tunnel, which runs parallel to the pool, exit the secure door (you need a room key to get in), a few steps across the bike/walking trail to a cute little sandy trail and you’ll see the navy and white striped Nautilus umbrellas and loungers. 

FOOD: The cappuccinos at the coffee bar in the lobby were perfect. The lunch from the Cabana Club was delish. We ordered the Cubano, Tuna Togarashi Salad, and Kids Hamburger. This was our 4th Cuban Sandwich on our vacation, and it was the best! 

LOCATION: I preferred the location of Nautilus (18th and Collins) on South Beach over the other hotel (9th Street and Collins) we stayed at before our cruise. It is quieter and more upscale. It’s a short walk or Uber to Española Way, the shops and restaurants on Lincoln Road, and the Port of Miami was only about 15 minutes. 

Final thoughts: Our 8 year old kid said this resort was her favorite part of our vacation - beating Atlantis and the cruise ship!!! We were married at Four Seasons The Biltmore Santa Barbara and the service level at Nautilus was beyond any Four Seasons we’ve stayed at. It was truly paradise and we’re already planning a return trip. My only regret is that we didn’t stay longer.",My extensive hotel research paid off…

We stayed 2 nights prior to boarding our cruise.  We arrived on a Wednesday about 6 pm to discover the entire block was having a power outage.  The hotel was great to come up with a creative solution to still allow us to check in and walk up the stairs to our room.  They also extended the complimentary happy hour for all guests that day in the lobby during the duration of the outage.  Our room did not disappoint. After reading the reviews, I had planned to request a room facing Ocean Ave, but with the outage we were just happy to get any convenient room.  Our room patio door opened to the courtyard.  We loved the quaint European feel of the courtyard and the fact that it seemed to protect our room from noise.  We loved our complimentary beach cart and toted it to the beach the next day!! We loved the Tommy Bahama style chairs and umbrella.  We also loved having the towel bins in the hallways to toss our beach towels in.  We took advantage of the complimentary washer/dryer as well.  On day 1 we had a reservation at the Havana restaurant, but since the power was out we walked elsewhere for dinner. We loved the staff, the complimentary bicycles, and the location! There is an incredible French sandwich shop around the corner for lunch. The historic Betsy hotel at the end of the street is worth checking out to listen to music in the lobby or the courtyard on the back side.  Definitely take advantage of the rooftop happy hour! We also visited the Italian restaurant Vino y Pan around the block where they literally stand in there and make the pasta. Such an incredible experience, but you'll need a reservation.

The location was perfect.  It was across the street from the beach, close to dining and museums.  We were able to walk to a lot of the places we wanted to visit.  I loved their live music and complimentary mojitos on the first night.  

The room itself had a lot left to be desired.  When we entered the room, there was no view.  Our room was facing the building beside us.  It was also a little dark and dank.  The bedroom itself looked beautiful, but look are sometimes deceiving.  Each morning we woke up, we noticed bites on our bodies.  After the first night, I thought perhaps we had been bitten while we were out.  But, as the next few nights rolled by and I had new bites each morning, I figured it was something in the bed.  Just before checkout, I contacted the front desk regarding the bed situation. A manager came to our room and inspected the bed.  He stated he didn't see any bed bugs or signs of them.  He suggested we had possibly been bitten by a mosquito.  But, they were supposed to call a professional to come out and inspect the bed and call to give us an update.  Unfortunately, no one ever called.  It's been weeks and we have not had a update and we have not heard a single thing from Marriott regarding our experience.   

I wanted to like this hotel so much!  The location was excellent, as was it's proximity to the beach.  There was even a convenient little beach cart with chairs and an umbrella in our room to be used on the beach.  The live performers were so great.  Overall the staff was friendly and helpful.

The hotel also features a rooftop terrace, which we discovered far too late into our stay.  It would have been a great place to spend an evening watching the sunset.",Highly recommended.

We wanted to stay as close as possible to South Beach and saw great ratings for Marriott Pulse. Definitely the BEST decision we could have made. Amazing location! You are literally right across from the beach, just a few steps away. Right on Ocean drive, this hotel had amazing vibes. The rooms were so good, and exceeded our expectations. So many restaurants in the area, you don't need a car. Bike riding on the beautiful ocean drive is a must. The hotel provides complimentary bikes to use. They literally had daily happy hour on the rooftop with amazing margaritas. 

Now for the most important part: Recognizing 2 individuals who went above and beyond for us. (Every single staff member was great, but we want to recognize these 2.

JC : This guy is by far the most nicest guy we have ever met. He was the first person we met. He stood out there in the humid weather waiting for us to arrive in our uber. Loaded our luggage and took us to the hotel. He gave us so many recommendations on what to do and which restaurants were good. Showed us ways we could save money on some activities that we wanted to do. Everytime during our 3 night stay, when we would run into him, he would come over and just ask us how our trip was going and if needed anything. Ive stayed at many 5 star hotels all over the world, but ive never seen this kind of service that JC gave to us. Just a great guy. 

Johanna - A very sweet , cheerful and kind young lady. She is the future of this hotel. She was simply amazing. Again, my wife and I were taken away by how great she was at the front desk. She knows every guest and remembers who you are and when you are leaving. Everytime we saw her, she ALWAYS had a smile on our face. We would literally look for her in the lobby because it would feel weird if we passed by and didn't say hi to her. She was so welcoming to us. Even when we were leaving she literally came all the way from her desk to the exit doors to thank us for staying and hope the trip was well. Its so hard to find someone so dedicated to their job these days. She is one of the rare individuals who just loves her job so much and has an amazing attitude. If you are going to book your stay at this hotel, call before hand and ask for her. She is their pre arrival specialist. Trust me on this and ask for her. I can see her one day being a GM for a hotel, she has that in her. Her hospitality was next level. 

Because of these 2 individuals, we will ONLY stay at this hotel the next time we visit South Beach Miami.  

Honorable Mention: Clartavia - She was also super nice to us. I believe if i am not mistaken, she has recently joined them and was in training. I would have never thought she was in training. She was working like a Pro. Just super nice and was always there to help us. We didn't have much of a chance to interact with her, but anytime we did, she was very good.",BEST HOTEL in South Beach! BEST SERVICE!

The Pulse definitely has that. Just two minutes and your on the fabulous Miami Beach South. You only need to cross the carfree Ocean Drive ,  just look out for bikers and people on blades. Then you may enjoy a carefree day in the sun.  
But the beach isn't the only asset. The hotell has lots of different rooms with a tiny kitchenette. A beach trolley is ready in your room facilitating your beach enjoyment.  In the lobby you may wash and dry your clothes for free. And there's more included. Like several drinks- and cocktailhours served on the roof terrace often with live music to enjoy or in the lobby. One of the 6 days of my stay they even had a flamenco dancer.  One day I was given a bike for 2 hours and enjoyed a ride on the bike and pedestrian path streching along the entire beach.
I stayed there the spring break week so    a lot of people were enjoying the South Beach. Lots of bars and restaurants to go to both on Ocean Drive and the adjoining Collins Avenue. 
Really helpful and friendly staff, a good bar and restaurant on the entrance level. A sign of quality is that the restaurant on street level was very popular. So nothing to not like? The hot water suddenly was gone one afternoon, but fixed next morning. So my advice? Highly recommended. Sunshine both inside and out all year ",The Pulse is vibratingly good.

I had a tiny balcony which overlooked rooftops and alleys.  You are supplied carts to take your beach stuff across the street to the beach.  I’m 70 and couldn’t do that!

It is in the heart of South Beach and in the middle of everything. To top it off,  -- it's oceanfront! 

We took our family for a four-night getaway in December. Our room was lovely and we had views of the ocean. We slept in the king bed and our son slept on the pullout couch. We still had room for all of our gear. There was a lovely welcome basket full of treats awaiting us! The room is laid out well to maximize space and the bathroom is super cute! It was super hot outside, but the air conditioner worked perfectly in our room. Having use of free washers and dryers was an added perk that we did not expect, but were extremely grateful for! 

The STAFF was world-class! Our Bellman: met us at the parking deck (at (ZOcean Hotel) with a cart, pleasantly loaded our stuff, and led us to the hotel. In all we were traveling for three weeks, so we had A Lot of stuff (yes, we tipped generously). He was great! We saw him from time to time throughout our stay and he was always busy wiping down the elevator buttons, handrails, bikes, and everything else. Even though covid was still happening, we felt really safe there. The Front Desk Staff: was Delightful! From the time we arrived they called us by our name... wow! They kind of sang our name in a pleasant hellooo Ms. ---. It was rather interesting and felt lovely. They were eager to answer questions and help. There was always a smile on everyone's faces. 

The LOCATION: We loved being immediately on Ocean Drive because we could walk outside of the hotel and be able to see and do everything around us! Immediately outside the front door of the hotel is Havana 1957 restaurant. I would've liked to have eaten on their patio, but there was always a wait, so we ordered carryout and to the hotel's ROOFTOP Experience. We LOVED eating our family meals on the ROOF of the HOTEL! The view was GORGEOUS! In the mornings we had breakfast on the roof and in the evenings, we had dinner there. It's a perfect place to sit because we could see everything and were often serenaded by the music below. 

Things To Do: The hotel supplies each room with a cart and all the beach supplies you'll need for a good time! Walk outside of the front door and there’s the South Beach!
The hotel has bikes in the lobby and you can check them out for 2 hours at a time. We did this multiple times and rode along the beach, paths, or Ocean Drive. 
We often walked to Lincoln Mall 5-7 minutes, Venezuelan Bakery for breakfast (3-5 minutes), or to Washington Avenue to catch the Big Bus. 
We ate several meals on Espanola Way... LOVE IT THERE! The Mexican restaurant on the corner is our favorite!

We can't wait to return to Marriott Pulse Vacation Club South Beach",Wonderul Experience! Great Location!  Close to EVERYTHING!

The hotel itself is beautiful.  It is a city location, vacation club facility and any one staying here should understand it is not a typical marriott hotel.  We felt it was perfect for the area.  The staff were great and professional.  Our room was much larger than I had anticipated.  We had a small balcony with a partial view of the ocean.  The roof top deck was also a great place to spend some quiet time.  We had beach chairs and umbrella in our room and it was great to walk across the street to the beach.

The food at breakfast and Tiki Hut was delicious. Beach access within steps and service to set up chairs and umbrellas included in resort fee. Overall I absolutely loved my stay here. The only two minor negatives was there was only one working elevator the entire 4 days which made getting to and from room a very slow process and our room had not been serviced after the first evening.

You feel a bit isolated on that part of Collins Ave.  2) The hotel advertises a happy hour on the website and within the hotel but...but there is no happy hour. Drinks are expensive ALL the time. It was suggested we go elsewhere if we are looking for a Happy Hour. 3) No complementary coffee. The rooms have a nexpresso which is considered coffee by the hotel, but not by me. We had to purchase coffee in the gift shop for $3 a cup every morning.  4) There is no shoreline to walk on. This is a favorite activity for us and were disappointed to see this was not an option.

The bellman was exceptional though! Genuinely friendly and accommodating. The rooms are small, there was previous guest items under our beds, which was a surprise because the bed frames are so high off the ground and anything underneath is visible. My spa experience was disappointing. My facial was below average, but the aesthetician was really sweet. The pedicure was terrible. The nail tech was experienced, but rough with nail care, so it was uncomfortable. There was zero massage, just a swipe of lotion, so the discomfort wasn't evened out by receiving even a minute of massage afterwards.

So if you're looking for a hotel that is mostly adults, I would check somewhere else. 2 - Along those lines, the drinks at the pool were all over $20 and had very little alcohol.

It is expensive and worth it. I had some concerns ahead of time, all of which proved groundless. 

First, I was worried because we came during Spring Break and there were shootings and a curfew in South Beach. However, all was tranquil Mid Beach, where The Palms is located.

Second, I couldn’t tell the size of the pool from the website photographs. It turned out to be nice and large. Because of the garden setting you feel miles away from anywhere.

Third, from its website the hotel looked fairly sophisticated and adult, what with its Aveda spa and yoga classes. However, there were plenty of children there. My grandkids made instant friends in the pool and, as I said, had a blast. Their ebullience was not frowned upon. Also, children’s food options were ample, from the breakfast buffet (ultra pricey for adults, not bad for kids), the poolside gelato stand, pizza at the Tiki Bar, and many options at the Essencia restaurant, including the just-baked dinner rolls, really superb chicken wings, hotdogs, and fries, and off-the-charts brownies.

Finally, please know that the beach is “just right,” with soft sand and fun-but-not-scary waves. The water was a great temperature for swimming when we were there (late March). My only quibble was some larger-than-pebbles rocks underfoot as you enter the water, but these weren’t big or plentiful enough to require water shoes.

The rooms were large and comfortable.

As an added bonus there were a few iguanas by the pool, and a falconer brought a falcon to breakfast one morning (on a leash) to scare away the other birds. Excitement!

The elevator was very noisy and we could hear it from the room but otherwise the evening was restful. For the managers, as a rehabilitation professor I have a couple of suggestions- 1) there should be a clock in the room so people can see the time at night, there are nice wood mats by the showers but they are a trip hazard for seniors and we stubbed our toes on them. In addition ,the lighting in the room is insufficient for those with poor eyesight.

On its face, it's a ‘tres hip’ South Beach boutique, with a hip bar and trendy restaurant, but the reality is that its too cool for its own good. .Here’s my testimony:

I walked in  and really felt I found a gem…the lobby decor is tropical and it smells great, the bar looked inviting, and I noticed an on-site restaurant…but that feeling did not last long. I knew we were headed downhill when a very nice man, located near what appeared to be a front desk, told me that check in was “self service.” HUH? Yep, he showed me the sleek little tablet where I would have to check myself in. Within a few seconds, there was a problem…the piece of technology  that was checking me in  wanted payment, even though I had prepaid on Priceline. Oops. Human required. I was told to return in 10 or 15 minutes while my situation was ‘sorted out.” OK, so, no problem, I will just sidle up to the chic bar and have myself a Tito’s and pineapple. OOPS!!! “The bar and restaurant are closed Monday and Tuesday,” the nice man told me, and that was that. What kind of hotel has a lobby bar and restaurant this is closed two days out of the week?? So I had to talk a walk outside  and find my Tito’s elsewhere. 

I returned and in fact it was confirmed I had paid in full. Which means I could  “DIY” it  and check in with the tablet and get my room key. Which I did. The room…..it's not only that it was tiny…it was that there was no place to put anything. No drawers, no shelves, no storage. So my wife and I had to put our bags and backpacks on the 12 inch gulley  between our bed and the wall. Then, as  I was unpacking, I heard a high pitched tea kettle-like sound. LIke a dog whistle. It was quite irritating, and for the life of me I could not identify the source.  I went back to  the front desk to see the nice man, whose name is Jack, who told me to  follow him upstairs to the room. He immediately identified the source-- “oh, it's the toilet. That happens when you flush.” He then told me how to lift the septic tank and jigger the internal  levers until it stopped…which I had to do every time I flushed for the remainder of my stay.

The Wifi signal…one word…WEAK. Most calls wither dropped or were interfered with. The TV….again, way too hip, way too dysfunctional. They leave you with two remotes, one standard and one teeny tiny ultra cool sleek looking thingee you move with your fingers…but since  there are no words on it, just icons that were meaningless, I was on my own to figure out.

Cleanliness….well., if you don’t look under the bed or in the corners, you would be much happier. Ignorance is bliss.  I lost my phone under the bed and to my great fortune came  in contact with  cakes of dust begging to be vacuumed. Ew.

Ah, last but not least, the “Courtyard View.” This is an insult to the intelligence. What they don’t tell you is that the “Courtyard” is the  ""tres hip"" and very dark LOBBY!  No lush green sunlit garden. Nope. The dark lobby. Ergo, in the  room it's night time, all the time. 

The saddest thing of all to me is that the Kayak Hotel is sliding on the slippery slope of a terrible trend. It’s a  deflating, and depressing reality in our world: Human kindness, personal interaction, the feeling that you are literally someone’s “guest” is disappearing--not just from  the hotel industry but the service industry in toto.","Hip and Woke, The Joke was on me."

I had a fairly decent stay, but it was NOT as close to certain activities as some of the reviewers made it seem. It IS near a Walgreens within walking distance, which is perfect for travelers who tend to forget small necessities when packing.  However, take 'walking distance' with a grain of salt, dependent on what you're there for. I found myself Ubering more often than I expected but quickly rectified that by adjusting plans to combine  with how long I'd be away for the day. 

That aside, the hotel itself is cozy, safe and comfortable. I stayed on the 1st floor and although some reviewers complained of noise, I had NO such issue. If you stay on the 1st floor, they closed the door of the hallway that leads from the lobby to your room. That helped eliminate a lot of 'lobby' conversations & interactions. 

I found the restaurant/café to be a unique edition to this boutique-style hotel. I must say, I did NOT eat here so I cannot state much regarding the menu & food. I will say, though... I did enjoy a morning cup of coffee there and was able to linger out on the restaurant's back patio, which provided a relaxing vibe and flowy breeze while enjoying my coffee. That was nice and had a very decent ambiance.

Rooms were clean. Beds were a nice size. Although there was only 1 roll of tissue in the room upon my arrival, staff was pretty good about bringing another roll when asked. They provide you with a general number to text during your stay, rather than calling to the front desk.  I actually preferred that. I've always hated calling front desk for any reason. I wish EVERY hotel incorporated a text system for requests, I'd be happier with that method. 

Overall, I enjoyed my time there. Whether I stay again is solely dependent upon distance and my reason for being in Miami. If I am primarily relaxing, yes I'd stay. If I am there attending various things where I'd be back & forth leaving out frequently, I'd likely opt for a different location.",Decent Stay

Father's Day weekend was coming up and I figured I would book a quick trip for us to go and try a new hotel. Literally from the moment I walked in the lobby to checked in I fell in love! The ambience is to die for! The scent too! I am not too sure what they use but it smells so good. When you check-in there is no one at the front desk because it is a self- check-in (which i love!). The first night we stayed in the Cozy King Room. The room is really cute, only problem it was too small for my husband, our 5 year old and myself. Immediately I asked the gentleman working the front that night and he was nice enough to help me find something bigger. Unfortunately that night they were booked so he could not show me any but did put a note on my account for the person in the morning. In the morning I ran into the the girl that was working the front and she helped me right in the Hall way- they carry iPad's and they have cell phones. She quickly looked and found a Contemporary Suite that would be available after the check out and cleaning. We got to our Suite and oh my! That was room was amazing! Spacious enough for the 3 of us. The least best thing about this Hotel is the reservation part, if you want to extend your stay you will have to create a whole new reservation instead of adding to the existing one. I had that issue and since I had to do that I did not get housekeeping services done because I put the request on the old reservation. If you are wondering about parking, there is a parking garage right across the street. I parked on the side that would put me on the same side of the hotel and the elevator takes right in front of the hotel. Parking is $15 for 8- 24 hrs ( I know for sure 24 hours but there is a time range for the prices). The beach is right up the street. Ocean Drive is probably less than a mile away (about 10-15 min drive depending on traffic) Lincoln Mall is about a mile away. All in all this is a great Hotel. I will be staying here for all my trips to Miami!",BEST HOTEL IN MIAMI!!!

Larry, our front desk host, was a gem. Always helpful, accommodating, great energy and looked out for us the entire time we were there. Love Larry! 

The daily fruit infused water was a refreshing treat on hot days. The restaurant, Layla, was awesome…simple bites and great breakfast in the morning. Loved their lattes with pistachio milk!

Overall, our room (cozy king) was just enough for what we needed to do. Also the Le Labo body and hair products were fantastic! Did I mention the wonderful, inviting fragrance that greeted you in lobby was everything. Rooftop lounge and pool were a straight vibe.

In fact this is my very first review ever.  However, I was inspired and so grateful for the love, patience, generosity and attention to detail that FREDERICA and LARRY extended to us. The hotel is boutique for sure but in a great location, beautiful and a new concept that is sure to take off.  FREDERICA is a true Italian fashionista that makes the hotel come alive with her presence. She sets a positive vibe, solves problems professionally and with grace.  She took a short time to get to know my Wife and i that made us feel special.  The rooms are very well done Tulum style.  I would just suggest you ask for a room on the 2nd or third floor and not next to the amazing restaurant. Ive stayed at the top resorts around the world and the one thing that sets our stay a part are the people.  Larry greeted us  on our arrival along with another fantastic young lady and made sure we were comfortable in our room and went the extra effort to move us. He is a kind soul and true gentleman.  I say all this because i appreciated every aspect of the care the Kayak flagship hotel has created with an amazing staff.  This is an ""A"" team and they could open any hotel around the world.   If i were in the hospitality business i would do everything i could to hire the away and pay top wages because they are the reason this new concept will thrive.

That bed is so big we never knew the other was in it! The sheets and pillows were the stuff of dreams. The room is in a corner overlooking the outside dining patio. The plantation shutters open and the windows open so we were able to get fresh air! The bathroom door did get stuck if you closed it all the way and our TV didn't work except for half a day the whole week we were there but those issues were overshadowed by the WONDERFUL staff, from the Hotel Manager down the line, EVERYONE was super friendly and always helpful. Albert (the Manager), Patrick (hotel staff) and Sania (Layla restaurant) are particular standouts. 

We could hear music from the patio and in the evenings when it was busiest there was some noise from patrons but we loved the music and the chatter wasn't too obtrusive. We didn't have any issues with the elevator being too busy or slow. The rooftop patio is very zen. There are lots of plants but also good views of the surrounding area. The swimming pool is very small but the whole time we were there it was never busy so there were no issues there.

Layla restaurant has great food for all meals. It is somewhat pricey (but so is everything else in MB) but they use the freshest ingredients. My bff loves coffee and she said the dripkit was some of the best she's ever had. I loved the baklava! On weekends, guests are able to order room service since the bar and restaurant are very popular. We got a ton of food for supper and all we got were sides and the baklava.

There is very little parking in front of the hotel but there is a parking garage (and the Miami Ballet!) directly across the street. It's only a five-10 minute walk to the closest beach (we always walked right by Mr. Chow's). The hotel is a great starting point for pretty much anywhere you want to go.",All-around wonderful stay

The beach, oceandrive, restaurants, bars, shopping, all is nearby and you can explore all with a little walk from the hotel. The staff was very friendly. We had some good drinks at the pool bar and a dinner, which was good and not to expensive. The pool bar is a nice place to relax. I also liked the sky bar with the colorful dancefloor and good music, but it isn't at the top like the name mentoined, it's at the back of the hotel. The pool has a good size.

In all, besides of the good things we are very disappointed from this hotel. It needs more love and a better management. When you check the website, it looks nice and like a little paradise. But many small things made it bad at the end. Our room wasn't very clean, we had much dust in the room and the bathroom looked not good cleaned. Also the floor in the room was not clean, walking with white socks in the room made them not looking white after it. The bathroom is to small, the toiletpaper at the wall made that you can't sit comfortbale at the toilet. The air condition was bad, the temperature was set fix from the hotel, we can't change that. In every motel we had before in the US, we could choose our own temperature.
The corridors looked terrible, very old and need to be renowated. The pool is dirty, you should clean that more often. It isn't difficult to clean the floor of the pool every day. The handle of the shower at the pool is broken, the spa pool has a poor blast. It is not a whirlpool like anyone imagine when he thinks of a whirlpool. The wellness center was closed during the stay, no use of sauna or steam bad was possible. No hint at the website, that the wellness center is closed at the moment. At the reception was an advertisement that at the weekends, there is a pool party - this party was not more as a few rounds of playing bingo. Please name it as it is and stop dazzling your customers.","Good location in Southbeach, but don't be dazzled"

The prices are worth the one-block walk to Ocean Drive, so you can easily walk to restaurants, the beach, and nearby public parking.  The onsite restaurant had a great breakfast (not included in the room rate) and cocktails were available.  Nice pool area and hot tub, but disappointing that you could not turn on the hot tub jets (the handle on the timer was missing) and that whole area closed down at 8 p.m. so you could not enjoy a late night soak or swim in the heart of an area that is up most of the night.  Speaking of which, if you have a room facing the street (like we did) be prepared for lots of street noise and roaring sportscars into the wee hours of the morning.  The simple solution is earplugs since this is party central in South Beach!  

Much of this is an older property that appears to be recently acquired by Axel Hotels.  They really should make some investments in the property with simple things like luggage racks in the room, televisions that will connect to your own devices (like they say they do, but they don't), some shelves in the bathroom for personal toiletries, curtains that close smoothly, cleaning the windows, etc.  The old rooms have wonderful charm, but the walls are thin and the lighting is all very dated and/or plain.  Rather than an overpriced honor bar, it would have been nice to have had a refrigerator and microwave.  There was a spa advertised but all that I could find was a door that said ""out of order.""  Also, there was a gate at the ""rear"" of the property that opened onto the next street (full of great restaurants, etc.) but you could not use your room key to enter from that location.  Time to get that gate fixed!

And one last thing that I thought was odd.  There is a small drop-off area for guests to leave their cars when they check-in, but some of the staff is allowed to park there.  There were as many as three cars parked there at one time, which did not leave much room for the guests.  There is a large public parking garage (for a fee) just a block away, and I think they should pay for their staff to park there.  That would go a long way to making the property look more professional.  ",Superb location but could use some attention.

Unfortunately these are outweighed by the negatives including poorly trained reception desk staff who act like they are doing you a favour when you approach to ask a question and an even worse manager, who is rarely in the hotel when you ask for him. 

We stayed at the hotel for 8 nights and when we arrived were told our king room was not available and we would have to accept a two queen bedroom. For the length of time we were staying at the hotel we thought we would be priority guests but that didn't matter at all to the reception staff who were rude, dismissive and unaccomodating. The manager was even worse and didn't offer an apology for the mix up or any sort of free voucher or even a bar drink to address the issue. 

We stayed in the room one night and had to fight again with reception the next day to be moved to the room we paid for! Totally unacceptable behaviour for the face of the hotel and left a sour taste in our mouths at the very beginning of our trip. The toilet and sink in the room we received were also loose and moved around and when we told the reception this was also ignored. 

Overall, the location and pool are the appealing parts of the hotel but it is very poorly managed so if you have any complaints or any issues with your room do not expect to be served well. We asked for a late check out, as a form of restitution for our first night, and the request was met with distain. The reception desk will always start with, ""That is not possible"" as their go to answer rather than trying to accommodate and address their guests' concerns. I would not stay at this hotel again on account of how it is run. ",+Great pool/-Poorly trained reception and manager

As far as the establishment itself, i will never stay here again. The rooms were deceiving on the website! They cover up mold with paint. The pool has debris floating in it all day. Parking is ridiculously expensive and the ""valet"" attendant is never there. So you have to park across the street yourself where you drop it off with a third party valet.

Daikin Air Conditioning had an ERROR A3 and was not cooling properly.  We reported it to the front desk and an engineer was sent to our room.  He shared there was nothing he could do as the A3 error meant the unit wasn’t draining the condensation properly.  Because of this the room was musty, stale, and warm.  Not a pleasant experience.

When we went to take showers in the morning, there was no hot water. I reported this to the front desk and was told that the hot water would be back on at 1:00pm in the afternoon (after we checked out).  We took ice cold showers.

I asked the front desk for a 50% refund, and they said I needed to speak to the GM, and he wasn't available.  They provided me with his email.  I emailed him twice and never got a response.

I would not return to this property.  There are many nicer hotels nearby, with nicer amenities, working AC and working hot water.",Terrible stay - multiple issues

I literally have no negative/cons about this location. Did I mention this hotel was front and center on 7th and Ocean Drive, directly across from South beach?! We didn't need the ocean view because walking out to the sand was heaven in itself. Plus I don't care to hear the music and traffic throughout the night so the room was located perfectly. The professionalism, courtesy and kindness shared to my friend and I during this stay was 10/10. I have to first start off by saying that this boutique hotel and its staff were impeccable and extremely clean. The products lingered throughout the hallways and that was definitely a plus. Smelled and felt cleaned.
Shoutout to HENRY, MICHAL, and NELSON from the ( FRONT DESK ). Henry was the lead of this pack that drew me in. I communicated continuously prior to the trip, I'm sure I ran Henry nuts by calling often about my reservation but he catered to my every request with no problem. Michal was my morning front desk person who extended kindness upon giving me a breakfast voucher every morning, he was extremely sweet and attentive. Finally, Nelson who wrapped up our experience was so generous, holding our luggage while we lingered around waiting for a late night flight and used the time to get some last minute sight seeing on the strip!
Let me brag about the food here. Even if you do not stay with Majestic Hotel, you must give Ocean 7 a try It is very rare that I go to a restaurant and I do not have some problem with my order or food. THE FOOD HERE WAS AMAZING. I'M TALKING ABOUT FINGER LICKING GOOD , SEASONED RIGHT, THROUGH EVERY SINGLE BITE. JEFRREY & JEROME our amazing servers of ( OCEAN 7 ), little restaurant that sits on the property (partnered with hotel). We specifically requested to eat in Jerome's area each morning for breakfast. The simple breakfast was definitely made with love and we were shown MAD love.
And, at night we vibed with Jeffrey. He was our entertainment and the guide we needed. He kept us on point about everything as the other gentlemen did, and he directed us to experiences that he thought we would enjoy.
To be honest I did not know what to expect from a boutique hotel. I usually stray away from anything rated under 7/ 10, but I'm also realistic that everyone's expectations are what can drive ratings down. These 5 guys 🤣, no pun intended, really made us feel warmed and welcomed. I'm heavy on customer service and it made our stay worth it. I will definitely be back to stay with this property, hands down!!
Thank you Henry, Michal, Nelson, Jerome, and Jeffrey it is because of you guys that this trip was everything. Until we see you next time 🤗
Take care.

TLDR: The best example of how bad this place is, they literally jackhammered the kitchen at 120am. Every guest on the 1st floor called and they refused to stop because the kitchen was closed and that's the only time they could do it. According to the construction worker this was approved by Pedro and someone else to do at this time.

Not sure how this place has a review this high. Check-in is a small window inside a loud & busy restaurant so hearing is difficult. $61 for ""early check in"" for 2hrs early. $20+ a day, daily resort fee. $150 deposit per room which ""can take 7-10 days to release"". Paperwork states they cannot guarantee noise free rooms… 

We were on the first floor, can clearly hear the restaurant at all times. Fire alarm battery low beep in the hallway. Windows are frosted white so you can't see out, can hear noise from outside as well. The coffee cups are dirty, the coffee maker has dust on it. The closet has damage to the walls and is dusty. The robes have hair hanging off them. 

Rooms are ""renovated"" looking, like a flipped house. New floors and tiling from what it seems, new looking furniture. None of it is good quality, tile work is bad, furniture and beds don't feel nice. Dusty rooms, hard beds, all the vents and ACs are full of dust. Walls and door frames appear to have been painted a dozen times. The toilet runs constantly, the toilet seat is loose. Honestly we had 3 rooms for 3 nights, we abandoned after the first night and ate the no cancellation cost. 

Front desk does not know if they will refund the resort fee which is based on being here, said I have to contact the agency it's booked through even though it has literally nothing to do with the agency since it was paid after arriving, outside of standard fees. 

I've received multiple text from their automated service which I did not agree to. 

This place is appalling. The only redeeming feature is the location, which doesn't have parking you have to stay in the garage a block away. No validation or otherwise.

In my 50+ years of worldwide travel I can truly stay that Majestic was the worst hotel I have stayed at. We paid $271 for our room 156 on 1st Jan. 2023. I understand that it being the first day of a new year, surrounding atmosphere in South Beach was loud and merry and as expected. But we could not sleep at all due to the very loud and constant noise from the restaurant (which is the front of the hotel) that continued past 3AM!! The restaurant must have closed earlier but the kitchen staff was either having their own party or was cleaning the place and washing dishes that went on loud and relentless past 3AM.   It was useless to get out of bed and confront the staff. And forget the breakfast which we had paid for in our reservation. We were told that it will be offered only at 9:30AM and when I requested if we could at least have coffee around 8AM since we were checking out around that time, I was told NO in no uncertain tone. How can you start breakfast at 9:30?

The bathroom was by far the smallest I have ever encountered in any hotel. When you used the toilet, your knee almost touched the wall - no exaggeration!  The linens did not appear to be freshly laundered. The room was poorly lit. The shower handle was broken (yes, it just came off the fixture) and overall it was a horrible experience. The staff was either indifferent or outright rude!  I can go on but will stop here.  My simple advice is to just AVOID this hotel.",Avoid By All Means..Horrible Experience

We booked directly on their website which included breakfast. Breakfast was at the hotel’s famous Ocean 7 cafe. I was thankful they had our room on the 3rd / top floor.  The room was comfortable, not big but it fit 3 adults. Plenty of amenities such as towels and water bottles. No need to bring shampoo and body wash as it’s available in the shower. The only thing lacking was a mini fridge. We managed with ice that was available on a lower level. They offer beach towels for the beach.

Booked at last minute and cost was less than $200 which included free breakfast.
The Majestic sits at the hub intersection of Ocean Drive and easily walkable right across the street to the beach with numerous beach activities.  
The hotel is inclusive of an independent restaurant ""Ocean Seven Cafe"" which is is part outdoor cafe and inside dining that fills up most of the ""lobby"" so that the check in area is about 5 square feet.
Upon arriving at the hotel, I currently have mobility issues that require a can and stairs are a challenge.  I took the accessible ramp which begins a few steps into the ally between buildings.  I had to navigate over hoses, electrical cords and around a small work desk where an employee was was working at a laptop.  The dining tables and chairs on the porch were close together and I apologized as I wiggled through.  I can't imagine someone trying to navigate in a wheelchair.   
Check in was friendly and accommodating.
The elevator Is ""hidden"" behind one of the original heavy engraved art deco doors.  I thought it was very clever how the history was kept while updating with the elevator.  You do have to PULL the art deco door open by the knob which is very heavy to enter the elevator.
The rooms and hallways were small compared to more modern hotels but that's just the nature of older hotels.  The facility was clean readily marked to navigate within the hotel.
Room was a basic accessible room.  Bed was comfortable.  Although the shades opened...the windows were painted white so you couldn't see out.  Not sure about why that is.  
The room was well worth the money however at this time I will note that the accessible bathroom had NO GRAB BARS.  Not by the toilet nor in the shower.  I highly recommend that this be considered as a safety precaution for guests with mobility needs.
The Oceans Seven Cafe was extremely convenient, priced right and very tasty for food and drinks.  A fantastic spot on the patio or porch to people watch and dine. It appeared to be no lack of wait staff and they were all timely and attentive to me and others around me.
I would stay here again.  
I will add that even during my leaving and using the cane and pulling my bag, the Ocean Sevens wait staff were very quick to reach out to assist me as I made my way to the sidewalk for transportation.   There is a valet service and pull in area for UBER/LYFT making your quick and easy to access.",Perfect location; Accessibility needs improvement.

We went to the room, which was not very clean at all, the AC unit up on the wall banged when turning on, it was a nightmare.  We were moved to a different room, but this one did not have even a view outside?
There were no hotel facilities, when I asked if I could use a table downstairs, the answer was no and I felt I was disturbing them. The only place we had to relax was the room, which was not why we booked a hotel?  all hotels in the world have a place you can sit and relax, even a bar to sit at?  for 2 sisters travelling together, you want your space.
There was bags of food and bags of garbage outside the corridor everyday as there was no cleaning so people just left them in the corridor and stairway, it really was disgusting.
On the last day we asked to leave the bags for a short time as we were going to the airport, we were told this was not possible?, seriously, any hotel keeps bags for their guests.   They eventually did hold the bags, but I really had to beg.

There is a market in the basement for small things. That is where my compliments about Majestic end. 

After a nine hour drive, my brother and I attempted to check into Majestic at round 8 pm. The restaurant in the lobby was packed, but no one was at the front desk, and the restaurant staff was unable to help us. I called the hotel several times, with no one answering. My brother and I split our time between our double parked car in the rain, and standing in the lobby waiting for someone to show up to work. After about an hour, we called AMEX travel to see if they could get in touch with the hotel. They too were unable to reach anyone. Over the span of an hour and half, the combination of two AmEx reps, myself, and my brother were unable to check ourselves into the hotel. We booked another place as Amex tried to process the cancellation. The hotel manager was incredibly rude to the Amex reps, going so far as to insult them and call them stupid. The manager claimed to have security camera footage that shows that I never showed up (not sure how they would know what I looked like....) and refused the refund. After some further threats, Amex promoted the matter to their claims department. While Amex did refund me most of what I paid to the hotel, they did so at their expense.

I chose the hotel because the photos online reminded me of an hotel that the fictitious Hercule Poirot would chose. The hotel decor and service did not disappoint. Photos on the website were very close to reality. Many of the Art Deco characteristics like the fabulous floors and metal stair rails are original. The designer who chose the hotel’s more recent furniture, lighting, and decor had exquisite taste and they have mostly been kept in excellent condition.  We spent time in the foyer on the comfortable couches with plenty of small coffee tables to have a coffee or a snack.  The hardcover design books in the foyer bookshelf were a great diversion from the iPad while waiting to check in or awaiting an Uber. The air conditioning keeps the foyer and hallways very cool and comfortable.

We liked our room and the overall cleanliness, distance from the street and decor. The floors are wood so main floor rooms hear some clumping above, but luckily for us, it was not excessive. The bathroom fixtures like the towel rack, faucets, shower heads in our bathroom were rusty but these could have been overlooked if the shower had actually worked the first night.  We brought it to the attention of the hotel the next morning and they fixed the rain shower head so that we could use it on our second day. The take away is check your shower, safe, phone (which also didn’t work the first day) right after check-in. 

The buffet breakfast is very European with tasty croissants, two types of coffee, orange juice, cereal, cheese, ham and fruit. The website is accurate except for the cake shown in the photo. Who eats cake for breakfast anyway?

The hotel is non-smoking but the front terrace with comfy chairs and table seating is not. Both sides of the terrace have ash trays,  and because of the popularity of this hotel with Europeans, you can expect to be exposed to smoke wafting in your face at breakfast or anytime during the day.  I suggested to the night Manager that the hotel should designate one side as non-smoking, as we feel a “non-smoking hotel”  should have some outside space for non-smokers.

The location of the hotel is right in the “centre of the action” but it’s  not on the noisiest street, which is definitely Ocean.  Expect loud music from cars, scantily clad passers by, and possibly some drama from the hotel balconies across the street. 

On our second night there was even an altercation when a guest allowed two people from off the street to come up for a cigarette and eat a sandwich on the hotel’s  table and chairs.  Another person tried to come up as well, and the first fellow took exception, so there was an altercation with yelling and finally the “crazy person” left.  Before the third person tried to come up on the terrace, I told the night Manager and he said that it was “of no consequence to him”. Even when there was the altercation happening, he did not come out. Management has posted a private property sign beside the front door but I think there should also be a sign closer to the street that prohibits the general public to approach guests.  The guest was clearly uncomfortable when the stranger asked her for a cigarette and then sat right beside her on the couch to smoke it. She admitted to me later that the whole incident was very scary. I feel the night Manager should have come out and politely asked the non-guests to leave as the area is not big enough to allow non guests, and it would have been a relief to the guest who was in the middle of the whole incident. 

We  likely will not stay here again unless the smoking policy changes, but it was definitely interesting watching the Miami street life, walking to the beach, walking to restaurants, and feeling the ambiance of an original Art Deco boutique hotel. 

The hotel has made good choices in hiring Gabriela at the front desk. She is fully bilingual, intelligent, efficient and polite. Their hard-working, well-groomed and polite young men constantly cleaning the foyer, opening doors, carrying luggage up the stairs and generally being helpful are also an asset to the hotel and made our stay very enjoyable.",Charming Boutique Hotel Amid Chaos

The property is nice and refurbished, the hotel room is beautiful to the eye, the bed is comfortable, the bathroom has products with an exclusive feel, the staff are nice and friendly and will help you carry luggage and open the front door every time you pass.

But that was then. 

On our first international travel in two years, in a time where the Omicron version of Covid-19 is raging through Florida and USA, safety is the main concern. We were therefore shocked at the next to non-existent safety attitude among the staff of The Shepley Hotel. 

First of all, the hotel was severely overstaffed, meaning that it was hard to pass through the common areas and maintain social distance to the employees. Secondly, at least half of the employees either weren't wearing a mask at all or carried it on the cheek or neck. Since social distancing wasn't practiced at all by the employees, it meant that we were forced to pass an unmasked employee with only a few inches distance every time we entered or exited the hotel. The staff also seemed surprised that we declined to have someone come up close and try to carry our bags (Hello! Six feet social distancing!)!

The automated disinfection gel at the hotel entrance remained empty throughout the three days we were at the hotel - a symbol of the carelessness.

Funny enough, the room price included breakfast, but this had been cancelled due to Covid safety measures. Could it be more of a joke?! Coffee and tea was offered where the breakfast normally would have been served, but when trying to get a cup of coffee, we often needed to share the cramped space with an unmasked employee fibbling with his smartphone instead of leaving space for us.

I am sure that - once we are through the pandemic - The Shepley Hotel will once again be a great option in the nowdays desolate South Beach Miami. But based on the current situation, I strongly advise any traveller interested in not spreading Covid to stay away from The Shepley Hotel.",Frightening covid unawareness at otherwise great hotel

My only suggestion would be to consider a contract with a beach chair service as opposed to the little sand chairs the hotel gives out currently. For us personally, it would have been worth the extra ""resort"" fee to have that convenience and comfort.

The air conditioning unit was extremely noisy - to the point the staff asked for it to be replaced, this however didn’t make any noticeable difference. If your basic requirement is to get a good night sleep, I would choose elsewhere.",Ok hotel in good location

I Booked a room from Wednesday to Sunday since our flight was supposed to get into Miami at midnight Wednesday going into Thursday morning. When we arrived the man working at the front desk wasn't helpful and kept telling us they had no rooms for us. When I tried to show him that we had a reservation, he refused to look at my phone and told me that since we had not shown up right at 3pm Wednesday, that they canceled our reservation due to no show (even thought I paid when I booked in April). This made no sense due to the fact that check in started at 3pm but check out is at 11am, and since we showed up at 2:30 am early Thursday we should have still been able to check in.
We were forced to book a room far away and at double the rate, nonrefundable since there was very little available rooms in the Miami area. After we got some sleep I called the Shepley manager (Jorge) and explained to him what had happened earlier. When I told him the story he was able to find our reservation immediately and could not give us a explanation why the employee refused to check us in. He refunded our money and recommended to email him a testimony about what happened and he would forward it to the management company (Alquimia Hospitality Group).
After I emailed, we did not hear any word back until I did more research and reached out to management directly. I got in touch with Veronica Medina and explained the situation. After two days all she did was send me a single night free stay pass at the Shepley. After I told her that we did not feel that it was adequate compensation for the hassle their employee caused us, she said that she will not be discussing the situation further.

It’s like crossing over into a different era. Cool, quiet, soft sofas, pleasant music playing in the background. I now understand the raving reviews about the staff - I had a feeling they loved us just for staying there! Always friendly and attentive, ready to chat about anything and nothing, prompt to give helpful suggestions. Clean rooms with minimalistic decor of the past century, spacious shower, very comfortable beds. I always have a hard time sleeping on vacations and I’m super noise-sensitive but I slept so well at Shepley to the soothing humming of AC. I don’t know if we were lucky but I never heard any noise coming from other rooms or the street (out window faced the back yard). Loved the convenience of having beach towels and chairs, and they have a pretty good espresso downstairs. Lack of storage space in the room is my only minor complaint but toward the end I realized there were some drawers I could have used that I simply failed to notice. All in all, we had a great stay, and for someone who is very picky when it comes to hotels, this one lived up to my standards and I would stay there again in a heartbeat.

I was on the bottom floor.  I read all the bad reviews before posting.
Here was my experience:

Cleanliness:

Cleaning staff was exceptional.  I usually never tip, but did this time.

Staff:

The staff was unbelievably nice and accommodating...and don't forget this is during spring break!  Coming into this hotel after being outside was an oasis of serenity.  I was usually greeted by two staff members at night and three during the day.  

I once had a problem with my uber app, so they call a taxi for me AND make sure the driver arrives on time by calling again to confirm his current location during our wait.  They then come outside to update us on the taxi status.

Staff was always friendly and easy to talk to.

I have been to the Oriental hotel in Bangkok, i have stayed at the Shangri-la in Singapore, i have traveled all over this world and i can tell you that the staff was more helpful and friendly than any hotel staff i have encountered.

The beds were very comfortable, the boutique old sea style luggage furniture was charming.

Reality check:

This is a 1938 historic hotel.  You will hear foot steps above you.  Get a suite on the second floor to avoid that if it bothers you.

If you need more space, get a suite. My room was small but adequate for the price.
This is a bare bones hotel with no bar or cafe.

Final comments:

Location is divine.  I took the (now free) bus 150 from the airport.  It drops you off 80 meters from the hotel.

You are a block away from the beach, and from Washington ave.  This location is perfect. There is a walgreens very close.

Nice boutique historic hotel.",Affordable luxury

We took a chance on Posh, even though it was slightly more expensive than others.

The first impression was good; unlike other hostels I've stayed at both in Miami Beach and elsewhere, Posh has professional, paid staff instead of random ""volunteers"" who only get compensated with room and board. It appears that Posh is affiliated with nearby hotels like Whitelaw and shares staff with them.

Special shoutout to Angel who checked us in and took care of us during our 3 week stay. We came in late at night and usually, overnight staff are tired and grumpy, but Angel was upbeat and friendly and put us in a good spot when we said we wanted to avoid foot traffic and noise.

I liked that you get a free towel upon check-in and can trade it in every day to get a fresh one. Also, they have on-site laundry (bring your own quarters and detergent).

My favorite part of Posh is how good it is for meeting new people, which is the most important part of any hostel. They have a big kitchen / living room with a large TV, sofa, and lots of stools. There's also a pool (unheated, unfortunately) open until around 7 PM with a sundeck and lots of lounge chairs, and a downstairs patio area as well. While there's no free breakfast/dinner, they do have a free daily happy hour at a nearby affiliated hotel; as much gin/vodka + juice as you can drink (make sure to leave a tip though!)

Like any hostel, things can get rowdy especially around holidays, but Posh has on-site security to keep things safe and to remove the occasional guest who creates a bad experience for everyone else. Another shoutout for Angel's professionalism in this regard; while working on my laptop upstairs, I see him graciously open doors for guests who've forgotten their keys, walk up and down the halls to make sure everything's in order, and I've even seen him pitch in to do some cleanup (probably not his job) to make the place look presentable. He is definitely treating his job at a hostel as if he is a manager at the Four Seasons, and whatever you folks are paying him, it isn't enough.

A little constructive feedback for Posh is to repair the fridge/freezer and the laundry coin machine. Also, improve the plumbing of the toilets (they clog easily), and get a bigger water heater. Overall, had a great experience and I'll be back!",Best Overall Hostel in Miami Beach!

For what you’re paying you get a lot!
The location is perfect, Ocean Drive, beach and outdoor gym less than 5 minutes away. The hotel pool is super nice and I enjoyed spending time in the shared space meeting a lot of cool people, having dinners, movie nights and such.
Staff always helpful! (Especially my man Angel!)

The kitchen was almost useless, the first days the microwave (which was the only way to cook) was useless, so they replaced it with another one that was no good either. After that they took long, it wasn't after someone got really mad (I mean reaaally mad) that they finally gave us a working one. Giving this context, some guests started cooking with their own kitchen ware, so after seeing this I did the same, but then I got told that I wasn't allowed to do that. ""Ok no problem..."" I said. But later the manager came and told me that if I ever do that again I will be expelled inmediately. With that attitude, when there wasn't any need.
The security came many many nights to tell us to be quiet in the lobby, starting at 8pm... 8pm!!! We were just having dinner and chatting, we weren't making a party or so, we weren't like super noisy either. They have a no noise policy that starts at 11pm, 8pm was ridiculous. At Halloween Night we came back at 4am, suuuper hungry, so we went to the kitchen to make some breakfast, and I don't lie when I say that we were whispering (because of course, we know the time we were arriving). And security came again to say that the lobby was closed at that hour and we had to go outside if we wanted to eat... No words. Halloween night is like New Year, and there wasn't any consideration for us even when we were being considerate of no making noise.
I had a very bad luck because the showers everyone prefered (because it has separation between showers and not only curtains) needed to be fix. My bedroom was next to the repairing showers and after asking kindly if we could close the door (there's a no closed door policy) because of the noise, dust and smell, our petition was rejected. The same person that complained about the microwave did the same for the doors and after that they came and closed the door.
There were some room mates that before all the showers issue closed the door once, and the management came when we were all sleeping and literally kicked the door, in a very savage way, and told my room mate that this was the only advice they will give about the door, the next time they were going to be kicked out. They could say that politely but no...
The kitchen is absolutely empty, NO CUPS to make some coffee, there's a knife but no cutting board, no grater, no working can openner. The girl that complained about the microwave and the door complained about this also, and say that she tried to open the cans with a knife, like a serial killer. On her last day the management purchased a can openner and she was pretty happy. Can you believe they purchased it for her to avoid a bad review and they left none for the hostel/guests?
Most AC sockets were almost useless, they didn't hold the plugs well, so when charging my phone it happened many times that it stopped charging after a few minutes.
The internet was most times impossible to use. I almost gave up on a trip I wanted to do because I couldn't book hotels or flights, I couldn't browse on internet as pages weren't loadkng at all.
I know that all workers there were just doing their work and obeying the manager so my complain goes directly to the management instead of the worker on duty. Still, I have to give a special shout out to Angel and Edgar for their kindness and willingness to help.",It's an empty prison (and I'm an introverted person)

Located on Collins Ave, conveniently steps away from Ocean Drive, Miami Beach and the main hub of oceanside Miami nightlife, Posh provides THE Miami experience. There's something about being able to walk around the whole city with minimal Lyft/Uber rides that fully engulfs you in the spirit of Miami. The heat, surroundings and energy provided me with immense motivation, positivity and a new spice for life!

The hostel itself was truly amazing. The staff members were kind, caring and helped with anything one might need. Immediately as I walked up to the hostel, I was greeted and escorted in. Excellent service. Check-in was smooth and I was given a tour and explanation of the rules and property. There are three rooms filled with two tier bunk beds. The bunk beds are large and comfortable. Larger than a twin bed. Plenty of room to stretch out and relax. Linens provided. 

The aesthetic of the hostel is beautiful. Clean cut, modern, simplistic design in nature with neutral tones creates a clean slate to launch off from while on vacation. The atmosphere of no doors allows for great friendships to be made. It is a trusting vibe where everyone is welcomed. You are provided with a large locked drawer that can hold everything you would like to keep extra safe. The design of the bathrooms, floors, showers, kitchen space, living area... everything! is beautiful. Oh... and get this! There's an infinity pool and grassy lounge area up top on the roof. I had to take a full day to enjoy this pool area. I couldn't believe the amazing amenities that were provided given the price of the stay. Posh South Beach Hostel, please never change.

The showers are not secured, someone can open the door while your taking a shower. The showers should have some type of shelf to hold our clothes up so that it doesn’t get wet. I’d be a good idea to have like a cellphone charging station in the lobby/kitchen so that people can charge their phone while they are asleep. I had to sit to the nearest outlet and take of my phone/charger so that I can charge my phone. I can definitely say the pool looks cool in my opinion on the rooftop. The good thing about this hostel is that it’s in South Beach Miami Beach Florida we’re a lot of people come hanging around the area in the weekend. You can’t bring any guest to the hostel. Kudos for Juanita the housekeeper for maintaining and cleaning the area, she did a great job keeping it spotless. And Anita for helping taking care of the area.",Posh South Beach Hostel

I was a little concerned because so read a lot of reviews in different sites(booking, google maps, and here that were a little rough but I didn’t have anything to worry about. The hostel is the perfect hostel philosophy. They host people that want to stay for a reduce price in important cities and their installations help to meet new people so it’s perfect for single travelers. The system they have it’s pretty good. There are some thing to improve  but I’ll definitely stay there. Things to improve ( their drawers are super loud and hard to open. Pro: are very big ( my carry on and personal item fitted inside with all my things outside them. Another pro it’s includes the padlock with key. The sheets were clean and a plis they have blankets include . It wasn’t or too cold or too warm, just perfect. The staff was really polite and helpful. The guest were all fun and respectful. The hostel has pretty established rules  to protect you and more if you are a girl. The kitchen was a bit chaotic and the fridge was stuffed with things . I couldn’t keep nothing I sent and you are not allowed to bring food or drinks inside the dorms. The water in the showers was perfect because you could get cold or hot whenever you wanted. Just would like to have a bigger place to putt my toiletries in the shower and closest towel racks ( to not violate the no nakedness rule). This reminds me to mention the towels situation. You aren’t allowed to hang your wet towel over your bed so you have to constantly change it upstairs but sometimes there aren’t any clean available so if you return it and want to shower you won’t have a towel so make sure you get a new one before you return yours. The bathrooms and dorms area were clean and you see constantly almost always someone cleanning up what make  mention the reason why I didn’t give 5 stars there was one of the cleaning ladies constantly shouting complaining in about all the things she have to clean . It was so uncomfortable to be sleeping in the morning and waking ñ up with her screaming super loud how much work she had to do. It normal in a place that host so many people that go to the beach constantly it’s going to carry sand and have some wetness in them . It really bother me and I stayed for 5 night and this happens every single day .",One of the best Hostel I ever stayed

He provides truly a five star service. Thank You. Also the front desk is pretty friendly,I was lucky checking in with Sabetay along with Mr.Lee,who also provided very friendly and professional assistance during the whole stay. I really appreciate both. The young guy,bartender is another highlight of the stay,also very pleasant personality... 
   Location is just perfect,so easy to just go around in the morning or any other time of the day for breakfast,lunch,dinner or grocery shopping. Walk around the block to Washington Avenue if you looking for local prices(I only figured that out during the last couple of days...lol) That way you paying $2 for Cuban coffee instead of $5 on ocean drive...
   The hostel has multiple bunk beds at the same rooms,which is unusual at the beginning,but during the stay,most likely you are going to meet quite few people and make few friends along the way,due to that particular layout.
   The staff cleans the premises on daily bases,but unfortunately some people don’t have common sense and are piggy enough not clean after themselves,which creates a bit of a mess from time to time. So when you are a guest of the hostel,clean after yourself,you are at shared space,not at home!
   The only downside of the place was an air conditioner set up at 72 degrees,and working non stop keeping premises very cold,and absence of cutlery in the kitchen. No forks,spoons,bowls,cups,and only one knife for that matter....
   That’s about it... 
   PS: In the lobby of the hotel they have happy hours for the drinks based on tips only(and let me give you a good advice on that..,the better you tip the bartender,the better during you going to get,so don’t be cheap...))) The drinks are very good,as well as the food in the restaurant downstairs at the lobby of the hotel, where they have a cozy set up of tables and chairs inside and outside of the premises with great views of Collins Avenue...

We really enjoyed the location of the property and access to dining, the beach, shopping etc. The property is an older building that is remodeled. The elevators are small and older but again location, location, location. The front desk is only in the Ocean Plaza building and we stayed at the McAlplin. We went to the beach on 2 of the days we were there and the front desk clerk let allowed us to take 4 beach towels and rent an umbrella and 2 lawn chairs from “Esteban's Place.” “Esteban's Place” is the company the Hilton uses to rent beach equipment which is great since I did not want to lay on a towel. The gentleman at Esteban set up my chairs and umbrella for me once I showed them my paid receipt from Hilton. The room had a kitchenette with a toaster, coffee maker, electric kettle, stove, and dishwasher. Landry was on my floor so that was a huge plus as my husband and I work out and go through so much laundry. The front desk gave us laundry soap too so we did not have to buy any. Walgreens is a couple of blocks away so that was nice we could get things we forgot or needed. 

The only downside is there is no pool and it would be nice if there was a partnership with the Hilton Hotel on Southbeach to use their pool. We did not really miss the pool at all though because we were at the beach and busy going to restaurants etc. There is a hot tub on the roof you could use that is rather small but it is there. We did not use it but I did go on the roof during the mornings etc. The hotel is across from a really nice part with a swing set and palm trees. I would recommend this property.

It close to all the restaurants and had a great view of the beach. Ocean drive was closed to traffic so it may for great walking. So many restaurants nearby, good luck picking out one for the evening. In addition, there is a walking path along the beach. This is the art deco district so the architecture all around was different and interesting. The Art Deco Information center is down a block if you are interested in a walking tour of the area. 
The room was perfect - nice and clean with just enough space to spread out. Much better than a hotel room. Only downside of the room was the trash pickup on Tuesday morning - wow was it loud (they do provide earplugs - use them!). The roof top hot tub was nice (not as nice as a pool), but generally not very crowded and it had a nice view of the ocean. Getting a lounge chair and umbrellas at the front desk was very easy and cheaper than getting it on the beach. The beach is excellent - clear water and nice white sand. 
The staff was excellent. Tall Paul was always around (does that guy get any time off) to help and the front desk staff was always nice and helpful. There was coffee and water in the lobby every morning; however, the Starbucks is less than a block away (order on the app and it will be ready by the time you get there).

The location is spectacular but you must like historic properties. First, the rooms are smaller than comparable HGVC properties.

Since this part of Ocean Drive is closed to vehicles, you must park your car nearby, call the hotel and the hotel will come out and move it for you. Do not bring a lot of luggage. You then park your car. We used nearby municipal lot at $20 per day. You could choose a valet option at $40. It is the quietest part of Ocean Drive but some service vehicles will use the alley directly behind the building and right under us. The noise was not bad but heavier windows might have helped. The rooms are clean and in good repair with a full kitchen but the halls are a bit musty and this is due to the heat and humidity common in beach front hotels. Staff are helpful.

Our first impression wasn't great.  The street in front of the property was closed off permanently.  So there wasn't a way to stop and drop off our luggage.  Fortunately, the valet at the Winter Haven Hotel was nice enough to let us park while we checked in.

During check-in, the hotel staff said that we could park at the nearest intersection at 14th and Ocean Drive and unload there.  But when we got to that location, the security told us otherwise, so we had to go back to the Winter Haven and unload there instead and had the bell hop meet us there to take our luggage back to the hotel.

The lobby and rooms were simple.  Not sure when they were renovated, but it looks like they updated recently.  I have to say, the sofa bed was one of the more comfortable ones I've ever slept on.

The hotel's location was right across the street from the beach.  The hotel made arrangements with a beach chair rental place for discounts.  They gave us vouchers that we could use and charged them to our room.  This way, we didn't have to pay the rental place directly.

The staff was really friendly and gave us plenty of recommendations for sightseeing and restaurants.

They place has a small exercise room as well as a hot tub and sun terrace on the top floor.  Unfortunately, if one is in the hot tub, there is no view of the beach or surrounding area.

We were there for only 4 days, but it was definitely a great experience.  Even though we spent more time sightseeing than on the beach, I would still recommend the place.  Wish we could have stayed a few more days.  Just be aware that unloading your luggage can be tricky.",Great location!

Usually it's a positive experience.  However, we visited on the last weekend of February 2022 and found a few issues that other guests should be aware of.

--  Ocean Drive is blocked off from 12th Street to 15th Street.  The roadway in those blocks is now pedestrian-only (bikes, scooters and skateboards ARE allowed on the roadway.)  This means you can no longer pull up in front of the property to unload luggage.  The doorman will meet you by The Betsy Hotel and take your luggage to check-in, but you have to call to coordinate this service.  Overnight vehicle parking is still available at the municipal parking garages on 13th Street and at Collins/16th Street for $20/24-hour period.

--  The elevators in the Ocean Plaza building are under renovation.  We stayed in the McAlpin location where the small elevator worked fine.  The work on the elevators has been going on for at least 1.5 years by our experience. 

-- TV reception was a bit of an issue.  Their (presumed Direct TV/satellite) TV service kept getting interrupted with numerous ""Lost Signal"" error messages.  Made watching shows and the news (Russia/Ukraine invasion) very problematic.

-- Although not directly an issue with HGV-Miami, traffic is worse than usual for those driving in.  In particular, Collins Avenue is under major construction in several locations in upper South Beach.  

All in all, HGV-Miami is still a very nice property once you get there.  The staff is friendly and, generally, the property seems well maintained.  Our 1-bedroom unit was comfortable and clean.

We'll get back here eventually, but the above issues took some of the edge off of our visit this year.  Hope they get both elevators working soon.",A few tips from our February 2022 visit.

We arrived in an early flight and they had a room ready on 4th floor but elevator in one of the buildings was still being worked on.  We took it… sure the flight of stairs were tiring but by the end of the trip we were used to them.  We liked having the small rooftop hot tub gym and yoga meditation area right in our floor.  We often at it all to ourselves ( maybe others didn’t want to take the stairs). The other building had a slightly large tub and we used that one night . The place was very clean.  There was a worker always cleaning marks off  walls, sweeping, spraying down high contact areas.   They have coffee tea in lobby available all day. And even got a new carafe when it was empty mid day for my husband.  We liked the upper floor because it seemed much quieter ..we had no issue with noise where you might on lower floor.  They beach is right across the street ..they give you towels at desk and you can rent chairs umbrellas ..they also
Can sell beer wine at desk as well. They don’t have a pool but you have the beach across the street , restaurants and shopping museums all in walking distance so we didn’t rent a car.   It would sleep 4 (2 in pullout couch ) but it would be tough with one bathroom and not much privacy ( pocket door from living/eating area)  but it was perfect for a couple.

That is what McAlpin Ocean Resort has going for it. It’s at the north end of Ocean Drive, which is quieter and classier than a few blocks south. This portion of Ocean Drive is, thankfully, still closed to auto traffic. You can sit out on the front porch area of either building and watch the world go by. Arlene, the assistant manager, was most helpful during our stay. She made the difference. The rooms are smaller than most HGV properties, but adequate. Ask for a higher floor since rooms on the 1st and 2nd floor tend to be darker since the next door properties are quit close. Both buildings have a nice jacuzzi on the roof with lounge chairs. Free coffee and tea all day. The beach is directly across the street. Lots of restaurants are close by.",Great Miami Beach Location

The building has 4 floors, and we stayed in a 1 bedroom on the 3rd floor. We were told the elevators will be down until October.

No one thing was bad as such just everything could do with a step up - room could do with a deep clean, so could the outdoor areas, the staff were 'ok' but no one special which is unusual in a hotel of this calibre.
The main entrance doors are really heavy they could do with pinning them open or offering assistance especially when you have luggage or shopping. 
Music around the pool was very same-y all day every day. I felt for the pool attendants who were hassled all day by disgruntled residents who couldn't get seats as the free ones go quickly leaving only those with a minimum spend or charge, luckily we were up early so it wasn't a problem for us. 
The location remains the hotel's asset, on South Beach and close enough to the action yet in a quiet neighbourhood so you can have some peace when you want it. Food and drink is now overpriced. Recommend Oliver's Bistro nearby for meals.
Hopefully Mondrian will spend some money and get it back to its former standard.",Mondrian

First is it not a 4*, it is barely 2*... pictures look nice but that is by far not the reality. 
We went there after a cruise for 1 extra day in South Beach.
The hotel offered us an early check-in time at 10AM, we paid the extra dollar and received the confirmation.  When we arrived at the hotel, the receptionist said that they are not offering early check-in, when we showed her the confirmation email, she said they are offering it but subject to availability.  Finally after arguing several minutes, she changed again the narrative and said: I have your room ready!!!  Bottom line, if we had not argue we would not have received what we have paid for.
Then we entered the room, our booking was for a queen bed, in our tiny room there was a tiny double bed, there was barely enough space to circulate around the bed. We went back to the reception to say that this was not the right room, she said that all the beds in the hotel where the same size and they are all large bed.  On the hotel web site you can easily see that they do have queen and king size bed!!!  
Finally, at check-out we asked the guy at the reception to call a taxi for the airport, and we got SCAMMED.  Instead of calling a real taxi, the receptionist called one of his friend. We first thought that it was a UBER but that was not the case.  We were in a rush but once on the road it was too late.  For a normal ride to the airport that cost around 50$, this guy asked us twice that amount to release our suitcases. 
So our experience was bad from the moment we arrived until we left that 2* hotel.",Don't trust the web site photos....

The location is also ideal for getting round, the Publix supermarket is in walking distance and Montys, is only a 10 minute walk which serves lovely food! We walked miles to soak up Miaim.  With the $ v £ exchange we found everything expensive on this trip.
If you want to go to the Bayside Market Place & take a boat tour, I suggest you buy the 2 day hop on hop off bus tour as this covers a boat trip and has a stop at the Bayside Market Place, more cost effective than Uber or Lyft and then the boat tour cost.  We learnt this after paying out!

 It was at an ideal location for South Beach and the hotel and room was clean. However the room is quite small which was fine for a 2 night stay but probably not if you're staying any longer. 
There was WiFi in the common areas of the hotel however this did not stretch to our room which was quite frustrating.
The staff were friendly and welcoming. 
There was a café at reception which sold some nice breakfast snacks and hot drinks. 
After our stay the hotel took an additional $80 from our credit card and are still yet to respond to us to what this relates to and there was no mention of any further charges on our check out. 
Overall the value for money is good but could be better if there was WiFi in the room and they didn't take an additional charge without informing us.

Hotel was nice but the bar area created so much noise that after first night of no sleep requested we change to a quieter room. Hotel agreed to do this but after thinking about it the hassle of packing up our bags we decided to stay where we were and chance another night in same room. 2nd night was worse with loud music blaring til early hrs. In the end we had to move to a different room as  the lock on our door broke and the room had to be broken into by 2 members of staff. The new room was very quiet. It occurred to me that the bar does not belong to the hotel because why would they want to annoy lots of their residents to facilitate a handful of noisy bar patrons. I may be wrong on this. And for fairness I have to point out that our friends who were staying in a similar location of the hotel heard nothing those first two nights. The staff were very friendly and accommodating and I got to practise my Spanish a bit. However I would not stay here again and would not recommend if you are a light sleeper.,Noisy!

The price is one of the best I found in Miami for a clean and safe place. It was across the street from the beach and they provided towels and chairs with cushions on them. We asked for late check out and they were able to accommodate that so we were able to spend the whole day on the beach and at their restaurant, Extra Virgin. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable. We did check out the rooftop pool which also looked clean but we didn’t use it. There’s a sitting area up there too that was nice. Didn’t have anything but a few chairs and table but if we wanted to go up there it was off the street so it was quieter. The staff were very friendly. Our particular room was on the first floor and looked a little different than the pictures. The shower was the same floor and stone/tile but it was not exposed like the picture made it look. Still nice, just not as fancy looking as the pic made it look online. Im sure other rooms are set up a little different. I think we had the first room closest to reception. It was quiet and we loved it! I would definitely recommend this spot. Walking distance to restaurants, bars, shops, liquor store, beach, Walgreens. We ubered to our cruise the next day with no issues! We would definitely stay again. We were also so impressed with the food at the restaurant … we had their brunch and it was really good.

The location was perfect, we walked everywhere we wanted to go.The valet parking is difficult to see as it is an alley next to the hotel, no attendant, you have to park the car if a space is available and take keys to the front desk. They take the car to a parking lot down the block so allow at least 15 minutes for them to retrieve your car. 
The room was small but well appointed, the bed and pillows were very comfortable. Unfortunately we were on the first floor and our window looked out to the alley and business parking so were woken up at 6:30 am by truck devileries. We were only there 2 nights so put up with it but I would recomend requesting a room on other side or level.
The pool is very nice but limited loungers, the beach was a short walk away which was very nice, the resort fee covered lounge chair, umbrella and there was also bar service.",Short  local getaway

Our room was the Premium room with partial ocean view and balcony on the 10th floor.  Since this is not an ocean front location, I was not surprised that it was more of a glimpse vs. ocean view.

Berkeley Shore management, if you are reading this, Robert is a reason why our group (from Canada) had a better experience.  Give that man a raise...now!

Thank  you Robert...YOU ARE AWESOME!!!",Nice Hotel...great staff...Robert is awesome!

We only had breakfast there in terms of meals but quite satisfactory.

So heres the good, the bad, and the ugly. 

Pricing/booking: I picked this property because of the location.   It was perfect for walking and exploring and standard room way cheaper than the beachfront properties right accross the road.  Now i paid extra, and wish i didnt.  Standard rooms are either on lower  floors or without any view (alley) or looking inside another hotels window. Standard rooms were about ~$170 in june.   I kinda waited last minute (a month before trip, and a lot of hotels in south beach were already sold out, they were better and cheaper).  This was a special occasion and i figured if the weather sucks we will live out on balcony for extra $$.  I booked the most expensive 2 double beds room they had which was double the standard room rate (see above and do the math).  Please see the pictures attached of what was shown and sold as that room type and for the price i paid.   When we arrived, i found that the pictures were misleading and the balcony was horrible.  There was a hotel foundation ""beam"" right in a middle of the balcony which was never shown online, which would make me reconsider and not pay $$$.   We never bothered sitting there, just ruined the whole experience.   Keep in mind ""partial ocean"" view is not because of the beam, but because of the other hotels in front of it blocking the view.   The the hotel beam just killed the vibe.   Every higher floor has i think 5 units per floor (boutique hotel) for example lets talk about 7th floor: rooms 700, 705 ( numbered 5 and another one on the other side of hotel) are both on sides and will look out into the alley or back. Rooms 703, 704 (numbered 1, 4 on attached pic) are partial view but have a beam right in a middle of your balcony which ruins it and not what is advertised when they charge you double the price. Rooms 701, and 702 (numbered 2,3 on pic attached) are in a middle and are the ONLY 2 rooms on each high floor  that still have partial view of the  ocean because of the hotel location BUT they are without the blocking beam, which is exactly what is advertised online, and they are the same exact price as the ones with blocking hotel beam.  Not cool, and false advertising.  If i would have known this in a first place I would have saved my money and not bother with a balcony at all.  Shady practice. 

Rooms: I knew to expect the shower in a middle, which was still weird once we got there.  It was just uncomfortable.   One person made sure to not walk around the room when another person was showering, and in general just leaves a person  feeling exposed (mentally not a good feeling).  The bathroom was just a toilet, and a full length mirror right in front so you can stare at yourself  while you take a dump...I was embarrassed for myself everytime i sat there.  There is no tiny sink, no table nothing, so you have to come out, touch the door handle and then wash your hands outside.  Just weird.  The shower had a nice water pressure and nice shower head (rain effect).  The sink was a hot mess and water everywhere.  The outlets at the bed table was wonky, and had to use one accross the room.  Coffee machine was nice, and robes were a nice touch. We did appreciate the cooler/fridge as well. Our room was coming out to the pool and collins ave and eveb though there was a clear noise at night, the sliding doors took care of it, and we slept good.  Beds are nice and comfy.

Location: it was perfect. Easy 5 min walk to the beach, included loungers was a convenient touch.  Restaurants all around, cvs and walgreens and a mall near by. This hotel is included as a pickup spot for a key west day trip which was nice if you are thinking of doing that.

The staff was pleasant, but quite a few did not speak English (housekeeping). Fitness room is the tinniest I have ever seen but airconditioned and nobody was ever there. The pool area looked nice but we never used it. Cannot speak on parking or the inhouse restaurant.  Check in and check out was a breeze.  They do hold a deposit of $300 😳 which they give back of course if you dont break stuff.",Ok if you book the cheapest option

In reading the previous reviews before I chose this hotel I was a bit nervous because some of them were really bad.  I’m glad that I followed through and booked this hotel.  

The location was perfect, walkable to tons of restaurants, a Walgreens/liquor store, and the beach.  Did not have to rent a car, could walk or Uber to anything we wanted to do.  The restaurant at the hotel had very good food and drinks and had a large outdoor seating area to enjoy the nice weather and also to people watch.  We were given vouchers for a complimentary “continental” breakfast for every morning of our stay.  Their version of “continental” was an egg (cooked to order), toast, a bowl of fresh fruit, coffee and juice.  It was very good and more than I eat for breakfast on any given day. There was a happy hour (4-7?)every day with discounted drinks and apps.  Also, as a guest of the hotel you receive 20% off  your bill for any food you purchase.  It rained our last evening and it was great to be able to eat dinner there and not have to get wet walking somewhere else for dinner.

The pool was small but nice, there appeared to be a decent gym and the ice machine and water/sparkling water dispenser by the pool were a nice touch. There was one day that the ice machine was not working but they gave us ice at the bar.  The hotel is one block from the beach and Loews (Boucher Brothers rentals) has an agreement with the hotel, two complimentary chaise longues and towels per day per room.  Umbrella rental is approx. $30/day.  Food and beverage service on the beach (from Loews) is good, although a bit pricey and the servers were stretched a little thin due to lots of orders. The drinks were good and my chicken caesar wrap was very good quality.

The beds and the shower were very nice.  The shower itself was in the middle of the room but frosted so that you could not see in.  We opted for the premier Plus room with balcony overlooking the pool and partial ocean view.  Was very happy with our choice.  Our group was in Rm. 701 (end room) and 704.  It is my observation that if you stay on the 4th floor or higher that you might have the better experience, and maybe this is where the negative reviews come from.  The front of the hotel facing Collins Ave. only goes up to the 3rd floor, any room facing the street could be a bit noisy from the street traffic, any room on the 1st floor is close to the lobby/bar and could be noisy. 

Here are a few observations for full disclosure:
-try to stay in a room on a higher floor (farther from the street noise)
-walls could be a bit thin, every time someone flushed in another room it was loud
-there were no drawers to put your clothing away, just a closet and a couple of cubbies
-the mini frig is actually a cooler, not a refrig..It did keep things pretty cold, though.
-no microwave in the room
-lighting by the bathroom sink was not ideal for applying makeup.
-only one staff member at check-in desk at any given time due to this not being a huge hotel.  You may have to wait a bit if several groups are checking in at the same time or need assistance with something.  However, the staff were very courteous and helpful.

Overall we had a wonderful time in South Beach and due to our positive experience at Iberostar Berkeley would definitely stay there again.  Miami is expensive and if you want to stay somewhere nice with a great location but don’t want to pay the exorbitant prices of a Loews, this is a great choice.",Great time in South Beach Miami

Location great, staff really great but a bit overwhelmed, beach lounge access free - excellent plus, valet parking although with a daily fee was a plus. The negatives are when we checked in our original room we booked was unavailable - “room wasn’t safe” we were told. Odd. So they put is another room which was “discounted” - no it was a crap room with a broken a/c and city view (the alley). After one night We asked them to move us to a room (balcony with beach view) more equivalent to our original booking which they did but with one bed instead of two. My bff and I were ok with that as long as We didn’t have to stay in the “discounted” room. Other negative was being stuck in the elevator on the 10th floor for at least 15 minutes though it seemed like a life time - The hotel engineer was super sweet and apologetic though.

We stayed in a high floor room in the older part of the hotel overlooking Collins avenue. My husband was disappointed that we didn't have a balcony or ocean view  (no upgrades happened to be available at check-in for Hyatt Globalists), BUT I didn't mind it with the skyline in the distance and pretty sunsets! He felt the decor could use an upgrade, but I appreciated the period piece furniture and eclectic patterns. We both agreed everything was clean and tidy, and were surprised at the rather generously sized bathroom for Miami (great art deco design there too). The housekeeping did a fantastic job keeping our room fresh every day, bringing us extra towels, and accommodating our schedule of when we would be in and out. I preferred the size of this hotel vs the huge resorts - boutique is definitely more my vibe. It was cozy, cheerful, easy to get around. 

The poolside chairs were cushioned and comfortable, but beware this is Miami, and they are packed in. Some seemed a tad on the ragged side. The chairs at the beach were not as comfy and could also use an upgrade. Staff from the pool to the bar to the restaurant to the lobby were all very friendly, helpful and they work extremely hard. The pools were too crowded for my taste, and the water quality was cloudy, so my husband never went in them. I went in a little bit. The kids swam quite a lot, and didn't seem to mind. We enjoyed walks on the promenade and beach (right in front of the hotel) and afternoon swims in the ocean when the water was typically more calm. 

The Confidante is close to plenty of other hotels and a variety of restaurants. We enjoyed Primo across the street for sandwiches and coffees, and Piola pizza restaurant for dinner one night. The hotel restaurant/poolside bar itself was incredibly expensive, so we were more conservative about ordering on location. Keep in mind all the hotels add on an automatic 21% gratuity to the prices that are already high. Two margaritas come to about $45. They also tacked on a $201 lunch to our bill one day, which we did not order. They refunded the money without too much hassle, but make sure you receive your tab each day, and I would get the printed copy of the full bill before you check out.

In all, I felt the hotel did an excellent job of keeping everything family friendly, but also fun for the young adults/party/influencer types. Music by the pool was fun yet chill, and everyone of all ages seemed to be enjoying themselves. The Egg Hunt on Easter was a big hit with my kids - what a ""sweet"" activity to have for families. My kids were bummed not to win the GIANT chocolate bunnies, but I was secretly ok with this ;)

Thanks for a great time - I would definitely stay here again!

Upon entering my room, I was disappointed to find that the furnishings and floors were in poor condition, with chipped edges on the bed frame and tarnished glass surfaces. There were multiple long hairs on the counters and tile floors. The tile and grout in the bathroom was filthy. The common hallways were even more unkempt and shabby, and one of the elevators was inoperable while the remaining elevator was cluttered with dirty dishes and cups from room service and so everyone had to cram in to avoid stepping on the dishes. It was evident that the hotel had not received proper attention for cleaning or maintenance.

Furthermore, I observed the housekeeping staff congregating outside our room for 45 minutes and when I asked them what they were doing they explained that they were basically hiding and waiting for their shift to end,  Despite the kind efforts of the manager and front desk staff, it was clear that the housekeeping and maintenance issues were pervasive.

As a loyal customer of the SLS brand, having stayed at the Beverly Hills and Brickell locations numerous times, I was shocked to see such a lack of attention to detail and basic cleanliness. My fiancé's first-time visit to Miami was supposed to be a memorable experience at an SLS property, but it was a complete disappointment.

While I appreciate the efforts of the manager and front desk staff, the housekeeping and maintenance issues were too significant to ignore. I have attached images to demonstrate the unkempt state of the hotel and issues I experienced during my stay.","Shocking State of Disarray, My Disappointing Experience at the SLS Miami Beach "

The SLS is in a beautiful Art Deco building from, I guess, the 1950s - but that comes some major drawbacks.
I arrived on a Sunday just before 4pm. I was told that my room still wasn't ready, even though check-in was at 4pm. I was therefore put in another room that was ready. Room 402.
There are two elevators in the hotel. One was broken and had a barrier in front of it. I waited for the other one. And waited. And waited. With about 12 other people. You see, there is no service elevator, so this one elevator has to serve 12 floors of rooms, and the basement, and all the cleaners and facilities and kitchen. So you ALWAYS have to wait about 10 minutes for it. And when you're waiting on the room floors, it doesn't say where the elevator is, so you just wait. And wait. And wait.  
Or you give up and take the stairs. Which are very narrow and dark and painted black, so you can't see them, so you might die. But after waiting for 10 minutes for a lift that never comes, it feels worth the risk. 
What they didn't tell me was that the room I had been put in, Room 402, was the smallest room in the hotel. So much for ""King Deluxe"", it was more like ""King Closet"". The bed basically took up the whole room. There was no wardrobe - a tiny hanging rail with room for one shirt. A small uncomfortable chair (whereas in the pictures there's a nice long sofa). And a tiny shower room. Oh and the sheets were nice but the pillows were all cheap artificial foam ones. Ugh.
Honestly I was so claustrophobic that the next morning I rang to complain, and was told I could change rooms - but I would have to check out at 12.00, and then check back in again at 4pm. (and no, no refund or compensation for putting me in a cupboard).
I couldn't stay in the room, so I took one of the nice pink bicycles round to Soho Beach house for the day and worked from there, returning at 12.00 to check out. Thankfully they were able to move me right away into my new room, room 1112 on the 11th floor.
Unfortunately now NEITHER of the elevators was working. Yup, the one on the left was still broken (and by the way it was broken right through until I left the hotel the following Thursday), and now there was someone fixing the lift on the right as well. So I had to take those narrow stairs. Yup, 11 flights of stairs. There was a whole bunch of us climbing the stairs, and a bunch of people coming down the stairs, so it all got rather amusing. Nobody died, thankfully. 
My new room (1112) was better - small but just spacious enough you don't feel like you're going to suffocate, and at least there was a bit more hanging space, a sofa with a little space to work on, and a bigger bathroom.  I still couldn't believe they'd put me in the cupboard room when I was paying $500 per night. But this was a nice room, If only the elevators worked.
I got lots of glute work-outs going up and down those 11 flights of stairs. 
The other crazy thing is that when you take the stairs down to the Mezzanine floor, you either have to go down to a fire escape that brings you out to some weird alleyway behind the building (kind of scary) - OR you can barge into the hotel meeting space, which has nice stairs to the lobby. But those are the only options. As it happens, my company was using the meeting space for our offsite, so we were constantly interrupted by people who were fed up waiting for the elevators and the only way to the lobby was through our meeting room.  As if the constant thud, thud, thud of the house music downstairs wasn't distracting enough...
So if you're planning an offsite, look elsewhere.

To summarise, if you like Art Deco buildings and have the patience of a saint and don't mind going up a dozen flights of stairs every time you leave something in your room, then this hotel isn't bad. The staff are friendly, the location is nice, the pool is great. But please, sort out the elevators... And if you get given room 402, politely suggest that you didn't come to Miami to stay in a prison cell.",Very tired and the elevators don't work

 On our way to Key West we stopped at the SLS and reserved and PAID FOR IN FULL an ocean front room. When we arrived back a week later we were told that all the ocean front rooms were occupied! Imagine that- paying for an ocean front room a week in advance only to find that our reservation was not honored!

The manager was young and only a manager for 3 weeks, and his inexperience shined brightly as he tried to switch us around.

We were offered an ""upgrade"" to a pool view villa and after negotiating for the hotel to throw in a free breakfast, free valet, and waiving the resort fee, we were taken to our villa room. Turns out the pool has blasting music that was loud enough to dance to in our room with the door closed. We asked how long the music played, and were told the ""pool party"" went on until 2 AM. Now, if I was a 20 something that might have been fine, but in my late 60s that was unacceptable as I find myself in bed an asleep at 2 AM. I don't think that peace and quiet are too much to ask for at 2 AM, but hey, that's just me.

We were shown a third room with an ocean view, but the beds seem to have been made for very small people and the room size matched the beds. Not acceptable.

I called around but all the hotels were pretty much booked unless we wanted to pay over $900 for the night. So we decided to just forget our night in Miami Beach and come home instead. The result of this was our also giving up our anticipated night on the town and our plans to see an old friend the next day.

I can walk short distances just fine but use a mobility scooter for more than a block or so. When my wife was talking with the manager he said that we didn't tell the hotel we needed a handicap room when the reservation was made. Funny thing is that I made the reservation in person at the same front desk as I was at when I was telling the manager how unacceptable his comments on handicapped people were.

As we were checking in another couple who had also reserved an ocean front room also were told that none were available, and that the fine print said that the room reserved might not be available at check in. They caved and took a lesser room, however mine had been paid in full.

 I have stayed at many hotels around the world from the Savoy in London to the Motel 6 at the Managua, Nicaragua airport, but this was my first experience at such a blatant bait and switch.

Shame on you SLS for not honoring our fully paid for reservation and then offering us another room where the music would be playing until the early hours of the morning. That was a dirty, underhanded  move on your part to oversell rooms in the hope that you could make more money on travelers who had no other choice. And shame on you for trying to blame us for not telling you of my handicap condition when I made the reservation right in front of the reception desk. 

A truly first class hotel would have bent over backwards to honor their reservation and if it were just not possible would have found us similar or better accommodations at another hotel on their dime.

I hate it when people try to scam me, and that's just what this was like. ",Scam bait and switch

The location is wonderful, rooms are small as others have stated but we expected it based on reviews. 

What we did not expect was the shortage of beach chairs at a beach front property. 
Our first day when we went down to the beach they told us they were taking names and numbers to call when chairs became available.. it was weird because there truly weren’t THAT many chairs out.. we looked around and there was a HUGE stack of chairs, I asked why I couldn’t have one of them, they responded that they were ALL broken— I’m talking like 50 chairs. 

The kicker was— they sell their beach chair access on ResortPass so the people who were in front of me who weren’t hotel guests got chairs before us. 
I’m all about people making money… But when you don’t have enough chairs for even your guests, I think you should prioritize your guests first…

 That night I went to talk to the front desk and I was greeted by a very rude man who rudely took a piece of paper with their terms of service and highlighted that everything was FIRST COME FIRST SERVE. No apologies, no nothing.  I understand first come first serve but when your guests are paying $600 a night you stay ON A BEACH PROPERTY you should at least have enough chairs for your guests if you’re offering them on another platform. 

All in all. Take your money somewhere else. Staff is rude. You pay alot of money and you can stay alot of other places in South Beach that are way better.",They could do better.

We had stayed at the Shelbourne a block away a few weeks ago and been really disappointed. Having stayed in South Beach before, we called the SLS the “SOS”….Style Over Substance as it’s where the ‘beautiful people’ go with Ferraris parked out front. We couldn’t have been more wrong though!

First impressions count and when Peter Erasme is your first point of contact as you exit a cab, be prepared to be charmed. He couldn’t be more helpful (even though we were only day guests) and took our bags, checked us in and explained where the facilities were. He even offered us use of a room if we wanted to shower before leaving.

The pool area itself was lovely although be aware the music gets turned up a notch around 11am (this was a weekday) as the hotel attracts a young set. This didn’t bother me though as I quite like me dance music (I’m mid 50s). The pool itself was a good temperature and length (salty water though) and I had a decent swim.

We ordered some food and drinks and it is not extortionate given the location ($10 can of beer, $24 for a huge cheese burger that I struggled to finish. They also came round with grapes and ice lollies while we were there.

When we were ready to leave, Peter again helped get our bags, call a cab and wished a warm farewell as we got in the taxi.

Just a shame we didn’t stay here instead of the Shelbourne as it was cheaper too!",SLS Day Pass Luxury

Location is right in the middle of the action in Brickell, within walking distance of 20+ restaurants and great shopping.

Staff were friendly, engaging, and very willing to help in any way - could not have been nicer.

The rooms are clean and groovy, but lacking some basic amenities like shelf space and towel hooks in the bathroom. If you're a lady with a big vanity you'll be putting it on the floor.

A big call out is to ask for a high floor. Friday and Saturday night there is a nightclub off the lobby; we were originally on the second floor (that is, right above it) and it was like being in the nightclub itself. 

Again staff couldn't have been more accommodating in getting us moved, but not really cool to have to do a room change at midnight.

Two rooms.  Loft suite 116 and studio suite / king room with living area 309.

PROS:  Kimpton Angler's Hotel is well-situated in Miami's South Beach.  Luciana at the front desk is incredibly knowledgeable and helpful.  The rooftop pool is spacious with attentive towel service and city views.  Housekeeping was responsive and attentive on request.  Food and beverage staff were friendly.  Morning coffee service was conveniently served in Seawell Fish & Oyster.  The municipal parking garage is located right around the corner, making parking a breeze.  Even with the close proximity to Ocean Drive, the resort felt private and we did encounter any noise issues.  The property is quieter and much more relaxed than the Kimpton Surfcomber.  Convenient access to the trolley.

CONS:  This is a high-traffic property that feels understaffed.  There were frequently long lines at the front desk.  Staff knowledge and helpfulness was uneven at the front desk (Luciana was great, her male colleagues less so).  The beach bag is disappointing for the resort fee -- beach towels were not replenished on a daily basis.  Beach umbrellas provided by the front desk were broken; beach chairs are not available.  I used a confirmable suite upgrade for a loft suite.  As others point out in their loft suite reviews, Room 116 felt humid and musty, and the bathrooms have not been updated and do not look like the ones in the marketing photos.  Many of the windows have an opaque white privacy film on them.  The ground floor pool is very small.  Rooftop pool bar and food coverage was short-staffed and not always immediately available.  Wine hour was difficult to find and sometimes did not start on-time; it was sometimes hosted on the sidewalk.  Staff acknowledged room maintenance issues had been previously reported but not addressed, including a broken cabinet door that had caused floor damage and shower drainage issues in Room 309.  Of the two rooms, 309 was brighter and felt more spacious.  Loft suite 116 felt dark and the layout felt cramped.  There was also no power outlet within phone charger length of the bed in 116.  The elevator in the Seawell Fish & Oyster building went down during our stay.  Guest services responded to text message requests, although sometimes reminders were needed and it took more than an hour or two for things that were desired quickly, (e.g. ice).  We requested several times an in-room coffee machine.  When delivered, it was broken.  There were no personalized welcome amenities or in-room surprise gestures for Inner Circle membership during the stay beyond the standard points and a bar credit.

Other reviewers have pointed out that the new building is in better shape than the loft suites or the rooms located in the Seawell Fish & Oyster building.  Common spaces and elevators in the new building did appear to be nicer; we did not have guest rooms in the new building.  I've stayed several times at nearby Local House and would probably opt to stay there for a future stay.","Well-situated, high-traffic, understaffed"

I strongly recommend this hotel and would have no hesitation booking again",Fabulous hotel

I do not usually leave reviews but the service was but the staff at Kimpton really went above & beyond. Hossain, Chawki, Gabriel & Luciana were all pleasant and super helpful. They were very accommodating of our early check-in & late check-out, were forgiving when we misplaced/forgot our key cards (multiple times) and were generous with their time: be it explaining certain rules or helping us out with luggage, etc. We stayed here for a girls' weekend & it was a carefree trip in large part thanks to their welcoming attitude. 
The beds were comfortable, the cleaning service is impeccable and the rooftop pool is a great place to lounge around. The food at the restaurant next to Kimpton is also great! The location can't be beat either: less than 2 mins away from the beach. Will definitely be staying here when I go back to Miami!",Excellent service: above & beyond

In fact, I have never had such a bad experience at any property before that I felt the need to write a review. Now on to my experience... it started off bad and just continued to go downhill. 

I was flying in on a red eye so I called the hotel well in advance to say I would be arriving at 4AM and would very much appreciate if a room could be arranged at the time. I was told that the arrangements would be made. I reached the hotel at 5AM and was told by the guy at the front desk that there are no rooms available and all the rooms are booked.  He said the best he could do was put my room in front of the housekeeping queue who come in at 9AM so a room could be arranged by 11AM at the earliest. I was not offered any water or any advice on where I, a solo girl, could wait in peace for the next 6 hours. 

I took it in my stride and waited in the lobby until their restaurant next door opens at 8AM.   11AM comes around and I head back to the front desk to get an update on my room. I am now told by two different people that check out barely begins at 2PM so the earliest a room could be ready for me would be 4PM (apparently the housekeeping who come in at 9AM takes 7 hours to prep rooms for new guests). They offer no apology and just claim that this is the best they can do. OK - I decide to just hang out at the beach until 4PM.

I come back at 4PM finally exhausted from waiting for a room for 12 hours now and am told the room I booked is unavailable but they will try to find me an available room. While I am waiting for an available room, two couples come and check in, and are led to their rooms. Finally, a ""suite"" is made available for me and I am ready to just put all of this behind me. It is not a ""Suite"" by any standards - in fact just a normal king room that is also grossly old looking. This room was in the building next door so I am not sure if the rooms in the actual hotel are better.

I get to this so-called suite, and the floor is all scratched up. The room does not look remotely luxurious or clean, you would think Kimpton has a certain standard. 

I just didn't want to engage and go back to the front desk so I decide to keep this room. The hotel is in a great location and as a solo girl, I did not feel unsafe at any time. However, the pros stop right there. Even though they offer free coffee/tea in the morning and a wine bar in the evening, what is the point if the service is so terrible and the room is of a 2 star quality. I really do hope the rooms in the main building are nicer.

Finally my stay comes to an end and the vendor I booked through included a $150 credit as part of my stay. I confirm this at check out. Yet one week later, I see three different charges on my credit card. I called the hotel to see why I was charged when these three would easily be covered under the $150 credit. I'm told by Anthony that he sees a credit on their end and that my credit card should show a charge and then a credit. I told him in many different ways that all I see are charges and no credit. He simply does not understand so I am now forced to dispute this through my credit card company. Staying at this hotel has been an exhausting experience both during my stay and now even after.  I am swearing off all Kimpton properties in the future.

",Just terrible..

It's such a shame that this wasn't our experience. 
We booked in for the night in February and like other travellers have commented, the location to Miami Beach is fantastic. Within a few minutes walk you're on Ocean Drive. 

Unfortunately that's where the positives ended. Check-in was chaotic with one person on reception attempting to be both check-in clerk and concierge, wrong keys for bike hire locks, guests taking out their luggage from storage and a queue to check in. After a long drive it was truly awful. 

The hotel is styled with a designer first / customer experience second, so the whole of the ground floor reception / bar & hallway inexplicably under lit to the point of darkness. Missing the mark of subtle, soft or kind lighting and sadly ending up just creepy. 

We had a room on the 5th floor and the air-con in the hallway from the elevator was set to Arctic - people were actively shivering. 

The room itself was pleasantly laid out and decorated well. It was such a shame that it was so dirty. Again design led and practicalities last. You'll see from the photos that the dust on the whicker lights and chairs was pretty gross. 

Personally I have a hatred for sliding barn style bathroom doors. This one was made worse by not staying in place once you shut it. I had to use a towel to jam it shut. The amount of dust, hair and shower splash back on it was disgusting (see photo). 

Plus the pillows are cheap and thin. 

Lastly, breakfast... This really is a bit of a comedy. It's served from 8 in the building next door. Service was slow and begrudging. (there's no coffee facilities in the room).

Not much was offered at this hotel in the way of charm, information or hospitality. 
However, if you do stay: 

My top tip is to use the parking garage on 7th Street. $20 flat rate overnight. The Kimpton offers valet only for $40.

She did everything she could for our early check in and we chilled on the beautiful outdoor pool area while our upgraded suite was getting ready.  we were in our room at 1:45pm.  Next we meet the outgoing truly helpful Madeline  whom served wine during wine hour from 5pm to 6pm outside in the court  area. She gave a wonderful recommendation  on where to eat.   Another  2 amazing front desk people whom assisted as I remembered the secert passpord so I got to spin the wheel was Cornelius  and Hussein.Lastly another awesome person  was Christopher R my spouse contacted the hotel for my birthday and i received a special surprise. I truly loved this place. The room we got upgraded due to our status was  beautiful  with a nice cozy balcony.  The room was huge,  bed was comfortable, the bathroom clean and massive with tub and shower.They do have a safe, a beach bag with 2 towels, robes, umbrella, iron and iron board and yoga mat in the closet.

They had 4 choices here which were amazing 2 whites pinot grigio borghi ad est, a chardonnay  can't remember  the name,and 2 reds: badger hound red blend, and Turning Leaf pinot Noir. All were wondderful choices. This area has wonderful  seating a big size Jenga. My only 2 negatives is its hard to tell this is a hotel because the name is hidden. Also the elevators  need fixing one of them the door closes right on you and the other had a strange smell  and was hot. Otherwise it was amazing. We took lyft from the cruise port it costed $25 and took 23 mins. We took the 150 bus to Miami Airport for $2.25 each it is located across the street infront of the CVS on Washington  and 5th st. Lastly the bar attached the hotel has good specials but they do include gratuity to check. Also if you have a shellfish allergy no fried food options.

The hotel itself is very nice albeit unremarkable. The service from pretty much every employee sucks. We arrived by car and there was no loading zone. So I double parked and unloaded out luggage. Finally, a young guy showed up and I asked if he is the bellman. He looked at me quizzically so I asked, “Can you take care of our baggage?” He says he can and fetched a cart. When he returned I asked about the valet. He tells me that is also his job so I give him the car keys and push the baggage cart myself. The front desk was empty although soon two clerks appeared. The clerk cannot find our reservation so I gave her the confirmation number and she found it finally. This morning, I wandered over to the restaurant for free coffee — only there wasn’t any. Three urns are empty. One of the other guests pointed out that fact to one of the servers who nodded and went about her business while the coffee urns remained empty. I ordered a $12 bagel with cream cheese to go. Fifteen minutes later here comes the bagel. I get back to the room and there is butter and jam but no cream cheese. I must say the bagel itself was very good as one would expect in Miami Beach. Other than adequate lodging , the level of service we received is what I would expect at a Red Roof Inn, not at a Kimpton property charging premium rates.",Adequate lodging in a good location but the service sucks

As it was our anniversary  i booked a premium king with balcony and asked for a room with a nice view,  the hotel upgraded us to a spa suite, & there was a bottle of wine and small crackers and spread gift which was a lovely thought and really appreciated, and also as IHG members we were able to check out at 2pm.  

From our initial excitement of the upgrade we noticed the room smelt really really damp and seemed to be a little dingy as if it had stood empty for a long time, we went outside to use the hot tub and on lifting the cover it was so full of leaves it was obvious it had not been cleaned for a while.  The patio loungers and furniture were also full of dirt and leaves. So we decided to head for dinner and forget about using it.  Also the dressing gowns in the room were quite shabby looking and really smelt oddly 'sweaty' on opening one :-(

On returning to the room we noticed that it looked like the door had been tried to be forcefully opened in the past and as this was the last ground floor room on the end we were quite nervous of this all night, as the area is behind a bus stop and not really a nice area!  

The next morning after returning from a walk to the beach we noticed the gate had been left open and there was water all over the patio, the leaves were still there all over the floor, side of the tub and steps up to it, but the hot tub looked to have been cleaned inside at least.  However we never used it as it still didn't appear 'clean'.

The reception and pool area was beautiful and we relaxed by the pool for a few hours before check out.

Unfortunately our room key had stopped working on return to the room at 1pm and it took a couple of trips to reception and 20 mins later to get back in.

The staff are really lovely and helpful, however on returning to the UK i have now had an odd charge added to my CC on the day after check out! I settled my bill in full, and housekeeping were radioed to check we had not had anything out of the room (which we hadn't) so i am still waiting for a response to my email to see what this is as its not anything i authorised! 

I wanted to love this place but the room given (albeit an upgrade) and the amount i paid for room only, i wish we had gone elsewhere.  I would not return.  If you pay for a spa suite, try and avoid 112 or at least make sure its cleaned outside.",A little bit let down even with a surprise upgrade!

The choice had fallen on the Savoy because, unlike other times, we did not want a mega hotel. The Savoy is a boutique hotel, but it is first and foremost a building listed as a historic building in the USA. It was recently reopened after a renovation that made it more modern and comfortable while leaving intact the refined and magical atmosphere of art deco style hotel. The lobby and rooms are tastefully decorated with great attention to detail. Excellent quality of sleep thanks to good beds and soundproofing. The garden and pool are a very inviting place to spend a relaxing day. In addition there is also a nice beach club. The location is great because it is in a very quiet corner of Ocean Drive, close to bars and restaurants. The manager Olivia perfectly reflects all the merits of this hotel and was very helpful in solving some small problems or simply making our stay more pleasant. Her attention to detail and service brings added value to this hotel.",Something special

Beautiful huge room with balcony and lovely bed. Right on the beach with two nice pools. 
Negatives…no restaurant on site, all the food during the day comes from the cafe opposite!  No bar/drinks or food after 7/8pm when they lock the pool area off!
Very slow service round the pool and food left around uncollected for literally hours, unless you’re fortunate enough to get the blonde lady poolside, who was exemplary at her job. 
No checks coming into the pool area from either the hotel front entrance or the beach entrance…and at weekend it was chaos, with an overcrowded, noisy crowd who were clearly not staying at the hotel!
Whether they were just wandering in at will for the day or they had some sort of membership to the pool area…it needs sorting because it will put customers off coming here again. 
To say it was rowdy would be an understatement! 

Also special mention to the room cleaners,quality!

Reception…need to cheer up and be a bit more engaging with your customers, make them feel remotely welcome!!!

To sum up, great hotel, great location, great rooms but seriously lacking from a food, drink and customer care perspective.","Fantastic hotel on South Beach,however…."

David at the desk was very helpful and microwaved our food that we brought back from restaurants. The beach crew was perfect. Bill was great! He checked back with us frequently and met all our requests. We asked to be in his section of the beach. Rico and Phillip set up our chairs and were very friendly. The only thing that we noticed that we didn’t like was the decor. They changed the lobby and pool area . It looked less art deco even though the Savoy is an art deco hotel. The pillows at the pool looked like they were from Target and they removed the cool art deco desk from the lobby and the sofas look pretty ordinary. And the pool area used to be painted with flowers and they were painted over with a drab green. But because of the location and they haven’t changed the room decor.

The hotel may be situated in a prime area of party-ism Miami (aka SoBe) however it's really well trodden - aka totally worn down. 

Keep in mind almost 100% of the SoBe hotels were in its prime back in the 1950s when rooms cost $50/night. Now some 70 years later, it's literally the same exact properties with a fresh coat of paint and perhaps a new floor and that about it. The Savoy fits that model exactly. If you are looking for a good spring break hotel room to party on - then this is your place. Otherwise the room is in really basic form cheaply appointed with IKEA furnishings complete with random questionable stains. 

The room was pretty filthy including water marks from beverages from the previous guests. The pool area is narrow and questionable. The bar food & beverage looked absolutely disgusting. They have a decent section of the public beach but who cares - literally everyone does on SoBe. 

I'd never stay at this place again - wish the owner actually took pride in keeping it a property worthy of its historic status given by the city, I'm guessing instead they jockeyed for that rating just so they could avoid updating anything, Walls are super thin as are the windows so you hear everything and everyone.

The one positive is that they feature Elemis products from the UK although the soap is mounted to the wall.",Don't believe the photos

And much more. My spouse and I arrived at the hotel on Tuesday, September 13th and stayed for four nights.  The property has an elegant retro flare décor; It feels like being in a romantic movie. The rooms were clean, very comfortable, adorned with a calm sophistication. The pools are pristine, and the private beach is a dream of nature and total comfort that invites to relax and enjoy life. There are two bars: one conveniently located near the beach and another high on a cement deck with an spectacular view of the ocean. Yet the most beautiful and impressive asset of this hotel is its amazing staff. They are sincerely welcoming, kind in their demeanor, always smiling and always going the extra mile! Every staff member I encountered, from the check- in (Rose was splendid with us) to the cleaning staff were adorable and eager to help. 
The bar tenders, the waiters and waitresses (we specially remember Tiffany), are like old friends, always happy to see you, making sure that one is having an outstanding vacation. 
As an LGTBQ+ couple, my spouse and I felt that our experience was the perfect (long due) honeymoon. We reconnected in ways that we had forgotten. It was literally like we became teens and felt in love again, all thanks to the romantic environment of The Savoy. David, the hotel manager, is the nicest gentleman in the world! Extremely professional, very accommodating, patient, amicable, understanding, easy to talk to, and a master in helping you to have the most comfortable and delightful stay that a hotel can offer! David and Rose made sure that our stay was nothing short of perfect. To all our friends at the Savoy Hotel a sincere Thank You from Michael and Christian. We are looking forward to seeing you all again!

Room decor, especially the sitting area of our queen suite, was super cute. Unfortunately a lot of the pictures of common spaces on their website are not current. The lobby furniture is a little more basic, without all the cute rattan boho vibes. The pool area is very nice but the beautiful mural in the pictures has been painted over. 

We didn't have hand soap when we arrived. One day water wasn't restocked, and the beers from the mini bar weren't restocked. Daily cleaning was good though.

The biggest room issue was that the mattress was broken when we arrived. They tried to find one to replace it but couldn't. They had one other room to offer us, but it was on the ground floor facing the parking lot and didn't have a rug, so we decided to just keep the broken mattress and my very kind husband agreed to sleep on the fallen side. If you are picky about mattresses and pillows, be warned that the beds are VERY soft, and the pillows very thick.

Bathrooms were standard but the shower design needed work. The open glass door/wall concept was a little too open and we were left with a soaked bath mat and puddle to avoid every time we showered.

Many reviews mentioned complimentary coffee in the lobby, but apparently they do not have this service any more. The free coffee pods provided in the room are not good.  

Staff were very friendly, and the beach and pool services were good. Room service took a while, but maybe that's normal.

I saw many rave reviews about the food, but we felt it was mediocre. Drinks were pretty good, not amazing.

We don't usually do vacations like this so maybe our expectations were higher than they should be. Overall we really did enjoy the hotel and the ambiance was very nice. We appreciated having the option of a smaller, boutique hotel. Just several little disappointments throughout the stay.","Good stay, but some disappointments"

On top of that instead of the Manger trying to expedite the process as there's now a line building up. He goes and grabs for drinks for the rest of his staff to drink. So at this point I was starting to get quite annoyed as I was just looking for a place to sleep. The drunk front desk attendant ended up canceling the booking I made online and they made no attempts to refund the room I had just booked.

The staff was above and beyond friendly. Geo (Jose)  at the front desk treated me like VIP. He accommodated any special request I had and truly became a friend I could count on. The check-in process was Fast, Fun, and Friendly. 

They offer clean linens daily and aim to make every guest feel at home. 
JJ was also more than helpful suggesting places to visit to make my vacation more exciting. I enjoyed the hospitality they offered and made me fall in love with Bikini Hostel.

It looked just beautiful. Loved the 70s laid back whicker vibe. Was often taking pics from different angles of the lounge, outside. My room also beautiful. Great attention to detail which didn't go unnoticed.  It was wonderfully quiet and serene. 
There was an issue with broadband signal in my room. I know, I know..f****g broadband but it did prove a problem over 2 issues where I couldn't communicate with staff. Also bad TV reception. Issues reported. If this is sorted,  the water pressure in the room is improved and just a little more professional and 'down to earth' approach from a couple of staff I'd rate this little gem 5*s.

Our flight was slightly delayed, causing us to arrive 40+ minutes after the 11pm check-in time. I informed them, and they assured someone would be on site to check us in. Even after hours, the staff was kind and welcoming.

The entire place was tastefully decorated, with the front patio area very aesthetic and comfortable. The music choice is fire, as the staff is all relatively young.

The location is great, as it allows you to go in one direction and hit all the places you're looking to visit while also not being overly crowded or noisy. The walk to Ocean Dr (5-15th St) is quick and painless, with many shops/things to see. The walk to the beach is <5 min.

At the time of this review, Life House, South of Fifth just opened up (~2 weeks ago), this could play a role of why everything from their website matching the in person vibe. If in 6+ months the online to in person vibe is the same, I would be very impressed and would highly recommend.

One thing to note, we booked the Standard Queen - but a week prior to our stay they called to inform us the AC unit was broken and being fixed. They offered us Deluxe Artist's Loft, or a couple of other nearby hotels that they would accommodate us at no extra charge. It was appreciated.

In the end, we chose the Deluxe Artist's Loft, and had a wonderful experience.",Website and in person is exactly what you'd expect

I'm also a  Marriott Rewards Platinum level member, so I've done my fair share of traveling and stayed in way too many hotels.  

When my wife and I checked into Stanton South Beach they did not have the room category for which I reserved three months prior.  Instead of telling me, they tried to put me in a different room.  When I realized, I naturally said this is not what I reserved and was advised there was no more rooms available for which I reserved.  Then I mentioned that the rate should be adjusted, and the gentlemen stated ""oh, I guess I can give you $50 off"" and have the manager call you.  First off, I had to ask for the discount and secondly they only took it off the original room rate, which was a higher rate than I was given.  So I essentially paid the same rate for the room I received, but it was not what I reserved.

I never got a call that day or the next, then when checking out, I resurfaced the issue again and was told the manager would call.  It's been a week and never received a call.

This was my third time at the hotel, which is very nice, but unfortunately it is my last time there.  I am booked here in July, but will be cancelling and going two doors down to another hotel chain that appreciates their customers.  Too bad they could have been upfront and offered me the other room rate and a discount or food voucher and I would have been back.  Take your chances, it's either great or terrible - not a risk I'm taking any longer, it's too expensive to be treated as we were.",Not a good experience!!!

Go to breakfast the next morning and can’t get back in my room because of door lock malfunction. 6 hrs later I still can’t get in my room and assured it’s been fixed. 2nd day there I’m asked to leave the pool area by a kid that accuses me of not having a room. Later that evening I can’t get in my room again because of door malfunction.on Saturday morning maintenance opens my door without knocking to repair door. Takes 5 minutes. Go back to sleep and above my room on the eleventh floor at 8:30 workers are pounding about my room with a jack hammer. I asked house keeping what it was and they explained that everybody should have been informed about repairs to the roof. My check out sat 3-18-23 was at 1 o’clock but I check out at 11 anyway. I asked Jason about my charges and he said it would be handled. The following Monday I call because there is no credit to my debit card and Jason informs me that they wanna give me free points instead of what I was promised. I call the General Manager if that’s what you wanna call her and she talks over me and finally says she’s going to credit the first night but not reimburse me for my belongings but she’d call me back about those and that she was sending me email confirmation which I never received. Tuesday I call and she says she’s not going to do anything and there is an additional charge to my card for $194 for checking out late, parking and I didn’t have a car, I got an Uber for everything and charged me for towels at the pool which I never received because I wasn’t allowed to go to the pool.

Yet you are still easy walking distance (or ride share) to all that you want from SoBe. It's also right on the beach. And when you leave an almost straight shot to the airport or Port of Miami. 

The rooms are clean, sleek, well appointed, spacious, and updated. And while some have ocean views, even the city views are worth it. 

Caryn at the front desk was a delight and very helpful. Outside there are two infinity edge pools with a hot tub in between.  The pool deck is surrounded by ample chairs and day beds as well as umbrellas, with a dedicated towel station. Across the walkway is a stretch of some of the best beach in Miami with hotel beach attendants and food and beverage service. Again, the hotel offers plenty of chairs, umbrellas and day beds. 

Service is above average and everyone is friendly and ready to assist. 

This hotel charges a resort fee. Normally not a fan because these are typically just money grabs used by hotels to show a lower rate online compared to its competitors. The value is usually not there, and it leaves a bad taste. However this hotel offers enough extra amenities to make it more palatable starting with two complimentary margaritas in their bar, 

INCLUDES:
* Enhanced High Speed WiFi this is not use for Titanium Members like my self 
* Two welcome Lolo's Frozen House Margaritas per stay
* Two beach chairs daily
* Bike rental (up to two hours daily, 2 bikes per room)
* One fitness class per day, per room
* 2 boogie boards per room, per day for 1.5 hours complimentary
* One complimentary specialty salt scrub sachet (one piece per room, need  visit the spa on the Lobby level to retrieve your sachet)
Amenities are based on availability and are subject to change without notice.

All staff were helpful. Beach staff set you up with towels, chairs, umbrellas, food, etc. (Rinaldo, Gianluca, Luke and Jalen and all of them from other days). Cleaning staff gave extra supplies as needed. Front desk printed out documents for me a number of times. Floride handled our room during a long stay. Lolo's Surfside Cantina breakfasts and lunches were easy and affordable and the Big Pink diner is only a block away, with giant portions of every kind of food you could order. The pools were too small for lap swimming but okay for dips, but we spent every day at the beach and didn't mind this. The facilities were a bit limited for a luxury hotel, e.g. small indoor public spaces, no business center (perhaps there is for conference-goers), and a small gym with only one stationary bike, Peleton, etc (I suggest the hotel put a sign up, saying ""please limit equipment use to half an hour if others are waiting""), and not a single work-out mat so you had to stretch on a towel on the floor. The hotel room's tv and remote were slow and our door lock repeatedly jammed until finally replaced, however the engineers resolved these minor issues. One nit to pick: The hotel's Starbucks refused to honor the free birthday coffee promised through their own app, despite accepting payment via the app all month. I mean, c'mon.

Beach and beach staff are excellent. The downfalls : Front desk staff not always friendly . Booked 3 rooms for my husband and I and our two adult children. Wanted to change our room because it was tiny, across from elevator and looked out onto a wall, got the run around from front desk staff who suggested I switch rooms with one of my children as this would be easier for us and them.  The beach staff is excellent ! Each room includes 2 beach chairs daily but you have to pay for an umbrella , which is ironic because the beach staff set up a row of umbrellas to line the hotel property and local beach goers “squat” under the umbrellas for free while hotel guests pay for their umbrellas.  The rooms and bathroom are small and there is no magnifying mirror as you usually find in many upscale hotels. 
Overall the hotel got it done as the location was perfect for us . When we visit again will choose a different hotel.",February family getaway

I came on my own for Vacation & was treated like I was an Alien the Entire Stay. 
I was judged for my physical appearance with everyone’s glances at me. Offering me a smelly room as I arrived & quickly demanded for a room change. 
The food was Trash. TRASH. 
The pools were Tiny & Filled with Pretentious People who look down at you LOL! 
My Biggest Disgust - was one of the Pool Employees named Caleb. 
He gave me the most Evil Eyes & pretended to be nice to me. Even asked me to Have Drinks & Hang out with him after his shift! 
Mind Blowing Behavior & Extremely Unprofessional. 
I’m a Psycho Therapist in New York & was devastated by this entire experience. 
(he also raised his voice/attitude with me several times to “check” if I was a Real Therapist). It was So Rude & aggressive that I was stunned someone that WORKS at the Hotel - wanted Me to “Prove” myself to them. 

Hahaha!!! 

The Drinks Sucked. Everything Sucked. 

When I went to eat at the Sushi Restaurant downstairs - they even Sat me with the “lower class” individuals. 

Racist. Demeaning place. 

I decided to Cut my Vacation Short & Checked Out 2 days before the end of my stay. 

Thank You for an Awful & Demeaning Experience.",Disgusting

That’s where the good ends and awful starts. First we paid a premium for a room for 2 adults and child. We ended up with a king size bed and a roll away bed, which the hotel was always trying to double charge us. Our reservation, which was book through Marriott site, included breakfast for 2 adults and 2 children. This was not the understanding the restaurant on-site had. They told us $50 was what was included. I brought it up to the manger who help me out with this issue, but had to do it for every day, which was 5 days to not get charged. The valet parking was a rip off at $49 a day plus tax, we were not even give any other option. When we were to the beach, even though, we three people, our reservations only included two beach chairs, so we had two pay for the 3rd one each day. Then we had the door lock not working and had consistently go to the front desk, which was aggravating and took time away from my vacation. Last, we found that some of the blankets used on beds were all mold.
The hotel management did nothing to help us through this disappointment stay here",Worst vacation experience!

Starbucks downstairs is so handy. Expect lineups as the local go there as well. Lovely beach just steps away.

Why I would choose another hotel over this one: The wifi is not reliable. It is non-existent at the pool and spotty in the hotel. I mentioned to the hotel that i was required to buy data for my visit (I do not live in USA) so that i could use my phone at the pool and they thanked me for the feedback. They did not undertake to look into the problem or fix it. There is a Hilton next door. Their wifi signal came up at our hotel, so i assume that stronger wifi is available. Its not a huge deal but at the prices one pays these days for a not luxury hotel and the resort fee on top of that, not having good wifi is really annoying.",Nice enough hotel but the wifi.....ugh

Rooms never got cleaned, have to beg for towels. And when we complain only snotty responses and an argument. Dirty. Not worth the money.
Will never stay here or maybe even a Hilton again.
Rooms were left dirty our entire stay.
And we extended our stay every 5 minutes to ask us if we’re leaving but takes 2-6 hours for towels and never cleaned our room Until we complained to a manager. Even then instead of fixing the problem everyone tried to make it like it’s on us. Elevators take 40 minutes to get. Double that because one of them stopped working. Front desk staff is not friendly when we complained on behalf of the 50 person party wedding that stayed there she replies with snotty remarks.
Let’s not forget you have to walk blocks in the heat to use beach amenities then the area is so crowded and the chairs are so dirty. Smells like pee.

Finally they come to “clean our room” didn’t take the garbage, left their febreeze lol; left garbage on the floor. But they finally made the bed and left towels right?! On day 4/5. 
So annoyed we left. I travel monthly for work and leisure and now I remember why I don’t stay at Hilton’s.","Terrible, dirty, not helpful or friendly"

Check in was simple. Room wasn't ready when we arrived but no issue we were able to leave our luggage and come back later. Reception staff extremely polite and helpful. We were allocated a room on the ground level in what seemed like the older part. The walkway to the room was like something from a Motel. The room was decorated nice but again because of the location was constantly dark. We then had an issue with the girl at the pool. It took us over 25 minutes to get served at the pool bar for food and drinks because she continued to serve a group of girls who were sat at the bar and were tipping her. When we eventually had our order taken our food arrived before she even had got our drinks. We had to constantly ask if she was going to get our drinks for us. We got frustrated waiting and out food had arrived so we took the food to our pool beds and asked for our drinks to be sent over. Another 10 minutes past before they arrived and when they did it was the wrong drinks order so we had to send them back.

I purchased the last parking pass which was great because parking is expensive and limited in the area. The room was a good size and to my surprise had two bathrooms! Didn’t remember seeing that in the room description. The only negative was that we found a few strands of hair wrapped up in a bath towel and the sink wasn’t rinsed well. We got more towels and I rinsed the sink - problem solved. 

Exercise room has a variety of equipment for vacation workouts. We didn’t use the pool. It was always crowded and closed at 8. The rear of the bldg has an exit to the beach. Wasn’t able to rent chairs when I went and didn’t ask about it, but they were locked up on the beach so I guess renting is an option.  There’s also a walking trail between the hotel and beach to walk, run, ride bikes, etc. There are several food options nearby. Wasn’t super impressed with the ones in walking distance. There’s a CVS across the street. There was a road detour and that was inconvenient and created a lot of traffic.

Ms. Caicedo then told me that I was talking too loud (I was visibly upset) and walked away, saying that there was nothing she could do for me to try and make it right, since whatever she would do would not be enough “for your kind of people”. It was a rude and racially motivated comment. As I was walking away from the lobby, I slipped and fell on a wet floor and no one even bothered to ask me if I was ok.

Well, you get what you pay for. This hotel did the job, but I would not stay here again. I brought my mom and toddler with me, and I would not say that this is a kid-friendly hotel. The menu options do not have any healthy options for kids (everything is fried food), the outlets in the rooms were loose and unsafe, the rug is coming up at the corners, and the metal parts on the bedframe were EXTREMELY dangerous. My toddler bumped his face on one of them and got a huge gash in his cheek from the sharp edge. I spent half the night with ice on it and then covered the metal parts with towels so that it would not happen again. In addition, my toddler kept waking up because the HVAC system would turn on very loudly due to the old infrastructure. While we had a place to sleep next to the beach, the hotel was outdated, not safe or suitable for children, and did not have healthy menu options for adults or kids.

We mostly had a good experience then.  Check-in was chaotic both the last time we were there and this time.  (Read my last review for how our last experience was.)  When I arrived to check in, I handed the receptionist a voucher for a free night's stay for the reservation. The voucher was from a promotion offered by Best Western. I understood that I had to book directly through the Best Western 800 number, and I had done that before check-in.  The receptionist gave me a blank look and then went to check with another person about it.  Long story short, they gave me a VERY hard time about redeeming the voucher, even though I had followed through with the correct process.  It took a consultation with the entire staff to finally give me one free night out of our three-night stay.  I was upset that I had to spend at least 20 minutes arguing with the staff, and it ruined the beginning of my vacation.  I reported the incident to Best Western. Rating of Staff: 2/5 for lack of competence. 

The room was fine.  No issues.  The location is lovely, near some restaurants.  There's a small swimming pool at the beach side of the hotel.  There is no hot tub, unfortunately. There are some lounge chairs in nice, shady areas.  Guests can enjoy the pool bar.  Be careful when leaving the property for the beach!  As soon as you walk out of the property to get to the beach, there's a ""highway"" of speeding bicycles, skateboards, and motorized scooters.  Look both ways as you would a busy road, even though it's technically a sidewalk.  Resort rating: 4/5

Average score: 3.  Sorry I could not do better than that for score.  I was not at all pleased with the way I was received.",Reservation Chaos

Also as expected be prepared to use google translate most of the staff can’t speak English ( which is fine because of the location ) but definitely worsened the experience of this stay Very indicated by the customer service of this hotel I planned my vacations in advance and made my reservation when I arrived they had canceled my reservation and they made me wait 3 hours to be able to give me a room being their fault for having canceled my reservation I asked to speak with a manager but none was available the front desk they are all mediocre they do not know what they are doing one says one thing and the other employee says something else they do not agree on how they should treat a client and more surprised that this happens in miami beach where there is all the tourism ,I would definitely never stay at this hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone as we travel from so far away and plan our vacations well in advance.

The receptionist told me I was staying for two nights when I had reserved four nights. I showed him my copy of the reservation confirmation that I received from Best Western, and the staff managed to fix my reservation on their end. 

I had reserved a king bed that was not facing the ocean. I had thought that it would be a small room with a king bed and not much else. I walked into the room on the second level mezzanine with a balcony style hallway that overlooked the lobby. I was very pleasantly surprised that not only was the room a good-sized room, but it also led into another room, which had a sofa, a TV, a refrigerator, and another bathroom. That made both my husband and me very happy.

I would like to comment to the management about our bathroom next to the bedroom. While I believe the maids did a great job with our room while we were at the hotel, I did find a piece of dark hair in the bathtub upon my arrival in the room. I do not have dark hair and my husband’s head is shaven, so I know it was not ours. When I went to use the toilet for the first time, it looked as if tiny pieces of ripped up paper were in the toilet.

The bed was comfortable enough. There was a double sheet on the bed. There were plenty of places to plug in electronics. There were also lots of lights. The closet was a lit closet and was very spacious.

We used the gym. It had two treadmills, an elliptical machine, and a bicycle. If you want to lift weights, they have free weights. One problem we had with the gym was the temperature. It was 77° in the gym and that’s not a good temperature for exercising.

We had some trouble with the keys for the room after we first checked in. Neither one of them worked, so I told Erik at the front desk that they didn’t work, and he immediately brought up two more keys. It seems to me as if they need new door locks, since one of our remade keys had trouble opening the door.

The people in the hotel, were very friendly, helpful, and courteous. They seemed to enjoy their job. 

The hotel had a large and spacious lobby. It is an older hotel with a small, swimming pool, and no hot tub.  The pool water approached out of bath water. It was so comfortable I didn’t want to get out of it. It was just a few steps away from the pool deck to the beach. 

CVS was across the street, and that came in handy. We bought milk, Cheerios, and other food items.  I got a blister on my toe while walking on the beach, so I was very happy that it was there so we could get Band-Aids.

One very important detail is to be careful when you walk through the gate to the beach. There is a walkway immediately outside of the gate. You will have to look left and right because bicycle riders treat this walkway as if it is a highway,  Don’t get hit by a speeding bicycle! 

I was fine with the hotel and already have my reservation for my January visit.",Mostly pleasant experience

But you still expect good service and care for your needs. We arrived to see Miami at the end of a long tour of Florida. We had loved all our Florida hosts up to this point, including another Best Western at Homestead. 

On arrival, tired after a long drive with two young kids we were told there was no parking available and we had to unload our luggage in the gutter and leave our children in the lobby to guard our cases as no porter was available. We were told to go to a local third party garage (way more expensive than the hotel, and way more expensive than the out-of-date flyer the hotel gave us).

During our two nights, we had two flyers stuffed under the room door by local fast food companies. This worried us that any member of the public can access the residential areas without being stopped by security.

The hotel is meant to be non-smoking but the people smoking weed outside the main lobby were not challenged. We know Florida has legalised marijuana but we would expect better from a family hotel to prevent the lifts and corridors smelling strongly. We don’t smoke ourselves and the residual odour was enough to make us lightheaded. 

We will be avoiding this hotel in future.","Good location, not good for families."

Lovely location on Ocean drive,  walked along boardwalk in the evening and towards the shopping area of Miami Beach in the morning before we left the hotel.
We enjoyed the free drinks next door, even though they wouldn’t let us have a table and had to sit at the bar. But the bartender was friendly and it was fun watching him make drinks for the 15 mins we were there.
Breakfast was slow and it was very sunny and hot right on the sidewalk where we were sat. Wouldn’t pay money to eat there again but it tided us over until we got on the Disney Dream ship.
Pool is down the adjacent alley, at the President Hotel. Small area on The fifth floor roof,  we shared a lounge chair as it was almost full. It was very sunny and there was an employee present, not sure if he was a lifeguard or not.
Hotel had a nice retro vibe, front desk girls were professional but not overly warm. 
You get what you pay for - lots of hotels within 500 feet that go for quadruple the price. Maybe there are cheaper places not right across from the beach eg on Collins.  There’s no car traffic allowed in front, so we had to walk a couple of blocks from our Uber, not a problem but be aware that you won’t get dropped off at their doorstep.
Worst part of our stay were the scratchy sheets, it was bearable for 1 night but I wouldn’t want to sleep a second night on them! Other than that, room was standard size, bathroom was clean, ice machine is in the lobby.","Cheap and cheerful, good for pre cruise one nighter"

We booked a couple of months ago and the only reason I did’t leave a 5-star review is that the cancellation policy isn’t flexible, I suggest you make sure you are aware of this before booking.

Having said that, our expectations were met and exceeded with the great staff including the wonderful Carmen at the front desk who was happy to print our our cruise boarding passes for us and check our luggage behind the counter until we were ready to collect it on our way to the port.  This allowed us to check out at 11am and hang out in South Beach for a couple hours more.

The included breakfast at Havana 1957 restaurant was good as were the beer/margaritas at Oh Mexico next door.  Both were included as part of the resort fee and I consider fair value for the fee of $33 per room ( 2 adults and 2 kids in our case.  We didn’t get a chance to try the pool.

Room and grounds were very clean, comfortable beds and pillows.  We were on the ground floor, and quite near the front desk, which we expected to be loud but it was fine.

There are more and less expensive hotels in south beach, if you want to stay on the strip and have the full experience I would consider this one to be excellent value.",Great Stay at the Penguin!  Jan 2023.

Stay was good cute rooms not much space though. The worst part is the attitude of people at the reception. They were very rude. I don’t understand why they hire someone like these people. All the time they look at the phone and FaceTime and they don’t care about customers. It was hard to comment with them. We took the valet parking by the hotel, they would call the parking team to get our car. One instance they never called and we had to wait 45 mins extra. 

Overall stay was good. Room service was good. But people at the reception big let down. They need to hire people who can talk normally.","Stay was good, not satisfied with customer service"

 I booked a Traditional Room 1 King bed with rollaway bed.
When I arrived at the hotel, there was no rollaway bed, my son had to sleep on the floor with just a blanket. The next day after complaining several times they took the rollaway bed.

Since we landed and came into the hotel we’ve been dealing with issues from employees. 

Morning 1:
At around 2am-3am we had other tenants get into a fight and yelling through the halls and front. There was banging in the windows and impossible to sleep through. You could imagine how inappropriate this looks for the other hotel guest. I thought this was over and maybe a tenant having a bad day with their significant other…but that wasn’t the case. 

Morning 2:
Around 5am-6am there were more banging of the windows and women yelling in the front and arguing that echoed throughout the hall. This was probably the straw that broke the camels back because we didn’t have one peaceful night and fear for our lives that if we complained these women would try to fight with us (I’ll get back to this later in this review) Why should we as guest have to be afraid to speak up to others who are being totally inappropriate? This is not okay and honestly the worst experience I’ve had in my life staying somewhere that includes the staff AND hotel owner. No security, pretty ghetto at this point and no one around to help guest stay at ease. 

Same morning after we were up working in the front of the hotel other guest started to complain and ask for a refund to the front desk girl. They said they were afraid to ask people to stop yelling and banging because they were scared that based on their tonality and actions this will only make it worst. She looked to her right to a man and he said “we don’t do refunds but we’ll gladly move you to a different room.” 

This same evening there was a lady that was sleeping in the front couch. (See picture) I came back after a late dinner and she then had a sheet over her and was sleeping in the front lobby. Like I said, this place is ghetto. 

So there I am trying to do the exact same thing other guest wanted and I already had my answer from this man who we thought was the manager. 

A couple of minutes continue and this man turns out to be the owner! Flaunting to his staff how he’s a millionaire and that they are only working until 3 so there shouldn’t be a problem. There’s guest in the front listening to this. My wife sure did as well and they did not care. 

That’s the owner! This is so inappropriate and I honestly didn’t want to be in this place anymore nor give them anymore money. I had written a complaint to Airbnb and they did nothing. Instead, it was sent to the front desk person who began to knock at my door while I was still sleeping in my underwear and she began to chuckle and smile because clearly I looked like I was out partying the night before and wanted to have a “chat” with me about my message to Airbnb. I have never done this but due to the current events from staff and owner I wish to leave and get as much as I can back from such a horrible stay. 

She told me that she talked to the owner and her said they can’t refund me because I was asking for most of my money back (I was morning 3 and the first two early mornings were horrible of course I want my money back) she then again asked me if I wanted to move to the back of the hotel where it’s more quiet (no thank you) and was offering that so that I don’t offer a bad review. 

If you have read this far, look up this place (the Julia hotel) and you’ll see in other platforms they have really bad reviews. I would absolutely not recommend this place and shame on Airbnb for allowing people like this in their platform and not being able to help out their guest.",GHETTO PLACE with thin walls

We found several great restaurants south of Fifth too. The hotel has been converted to an AirBnB operation only. There are about 40 rooms and everything has been redone. The rooms are clean and efficient with good AC. You do not get a view from any of them but few places offer a view anyway. It is only two blocks from the beach. The staff are around.

The SPA is nice with cool and hot tub.  It is near the beach and has its own chairs for guests but you pay if you want an umbrella. The restuarant is exceptional, Sushi and dressy, not casual.

We were treated with no respect, the staff is aggressive and unhelpful. If you want to experience a real Nobu - go to London or Ibiza. You pay more but you get real service and amazing experience. Nobu in Miami should be rated 2 stars or less. Dirty, sticky tables in restaurant, lack of customer service.

This hotel, unfortunately, is not one. This is in no way a bad hotel, and I would still advise travelers to stay here. However, the price point is overpriced by around $75-100 a night, and in reality it is a solid 4 star facility. The issues listed in this review may not seem like a big deal for most people, and they were not a big deal to us, but as a labeled 5 star hotel, these things matter. 

Airport transportation is not included or even offered prior to your arrival. When you reach the hotel, several staff members will be there to open doors and direct arriving vehicles, but that’s about it. None of these staff members helped us take our luggage out of the car, or carry it up the stairs into the lobby. We were assisted in bringing our luggage up to our room. And on departure the same situation happened in reverse. We received no help with luggage, and when we called down to the desk to ask for luggage assistance the phone continually rang (another common problem we faced in this hotel daily).

Upon check in, we were not offered any warm towels, any water or beverage. We were not given a tour or even an overview of the resort. When we inquired about our complimentary room upgrade as Expedia VIP Gold members, we were told no other rooms were available. We did state that online, other rooms were available to book, so that was untrue, she stated we would have to pay for an upgrade. We were then told to take a left to the elevator to get up to our room, again with no tour or luggage assist. 

When we got up to the room, it was very spacious, clean, well decorated. Lovely room with the Japanese style decor. We were given new bottled waters and nespresso pods daily. Housekeeping did a lovely job of cleaning the room daily. One thing to note, when we checked in, I went to put the waters in the fridge only to notice it was actually a minibar, but was missing several items in different slots. I tried to call downstairs to every number listed on the phone and not a single line answered. On our way out an hour later, we stopped at the desk to inform them the minibar was not stocked, which was fine, but we didn’t want to be charged for the items. She pulled up our account, and we had actually already been charged for them…. Within ONE hour of checking in. They did remove this from our billing but then it was later put back on and had to be removed again, after we asked them to please just come empty the minibar since we don’t need it. We would rather have an empty fridge. They did not empty it rather they brought an extra mini fridge. 

The multiple pools and pool areas are nice, also clean. Kimberly at the Nobu pool, however, was always lovely. Attentive, hard working, and friendly. She was a pleasure. However Not nearly enough servers for each area given the business of the hotel this time of year. They would run out of lounge chair covers by 12pm…. Not even sure how this happens.. Food constantly taking an average of 1.5 hours. Bartenders at the ocean social bar and the other pool bar were not friendly and attentive despite the added service. Before you would order food they would tell you how long the wait for it would be in a manner that sounded almost discouraging. The food, expensive but considering the area is expected, was average. Not good, not bad. 

Perhaps our biggest issue with the hotel, and this we feel is an important issue to note, is that on the beach, lounge chairs are complimentary but the umbrellas are not. Despite being a guest of this supposed 5 star hotel, an umbrella was $35 a day. We picked this hotel because we wanted to be directly on the beach. We paid close to $500 a night at a “5 star hotel” with beach facilities, only to be told we would have to pay every single day for a week, $35 for an umbrella. This unfortunately left us at the pool every day, a complete bummer since we came down to Miami specifically for Miami Beach. Absolutely ridiculous. 

We reviewed our check in as we were emailed to do within the first 24 hours of stay, and no one from management reached out to us. When we inquired we were told they were unavailable. 

Staff here seems to be a bit flustered, it almost functions like the hotel opened last month. Chaotic, unorganized, overwhelmed. 

Would we stay here again? Yes. For this price? No.",Most certainly not a 5 star hotel.

Paint is chipping on the doors and faucets, but overall the room is very beautiful and well appointed. The bed is super comfortable. We were able to get chairs by the adult pool every day. Food and drinks there are very overpriced for what you get and took a very long time.  Also, the music is ever present and a bit loud.
The hotel was doing some construction on a garden area which was very noisy at times. And one morning for an unknown reason we weren’t able to eat at the ocean view restaurant. There was a buffet instead near the pool which was decent, but not what we were hoping for.
The staff was very hard working and pleasant across the board.
The security was lacking. Guests are given a wristband and we noticed that very often there was no one checking them as people came in from the boardwalk/beach entrance.

I fell in love with Miami, and with the Nobu hotel, immediately. I’ve since visited Miami several times and I stay exclusively at the the Nobu. 

My partner and I booked our first post-pandemic trip back to Miami / the Nobu since 2019, for early 2023. I feel a bit weird splashing this out on the internet for complete strangers to read, but it’s relevant to this review…. Both my grandmother and my mother died within a few weeks of each other at the beginning of 2023, and as a result we had to ask the hotel if we could move our reservation dates back. They were gracious to accommodate the change in dates, and they even sent me a very kind email to express condolences.

My partner and I were finally able to take our vacation together in April - it was also the first vacation that I had been able to take in almost a year, due to my mom’s illness and eventual passing. 2023 started as the worst year of my life, no exaggeration, and I was really looking forward to a vacation. 

When we checked in, Sabrina took exceptionally great care of us. I cannot say enough about the level of care and service she provided. When we checked in, she had asked if we were celebrating anything, and I really couldn’t come up with words to say to someone I’d never met before what the trip actually meant to me. Maybe there was a note on the reservation from our previous request to move the dates, or maybe she read something in my face, but either way, she went above and beyond to make our stay special, with a generous upgrade to an astoundingly beautiful room, and a room drop with a very kind note welcoming me back to the property. 

I was already a loyal Nobu Miami guest, but Sabrina’s extra attentive service on this particular trip has really cemented a special kind of love for this place. I’ve been fortunate to stay at some really nice hotels worldwide, but none of them have come close to this level of genuine hospitality. I am truly grateful for the Nobu Miami, and particularly for Sabrina’s empathy and care. Domo arigatou gozaimasu! ",Above and Beyond

Although it’s a 5 star, it seems more of like a 5 star in the early 2000s. The front desk staff was great and very helpful! However, since it’s combined with Eden Roc, I think there are some gaps in communication. The person at the main pool told me that the pool on the upper level was closed, when it clearly looked open. I went there and not only was it open, it was the adults only pool for Nobu guests which she did not mention. Also, for being a 5 star resort I was shocked that they charged us to use the bikes. That was another thing that wasn’t communicated when I asked the security by the bike rack. They told me to get on the app and pay. I found out after I asked front desk that we get a free first hour. Still, for the price being charged to stay, the bike rentals should be free IMO. Also, another strange thing was that the conditioner in the bathroom was a completely different brand than the other amenities, it’s like it was someone else’s that may have been confused for the actual hotel kind.

When we arrived, we were greeted by the valet service, which was efficient, though not necessarily anything special or friendly. The shining stars of our trip were Chemise and David who greeted us at check in. They were incredibly polite, warm kind while still being very professional. They upgraded us (without asking) to an amazing room with gorgeous ocean view on the eleventh floor. They gave us all kinds of information about the property and continued to be valuable sources of assistance throughout our stay. They greeted us repeatedly, by name when we ran into them on property, and both called to check on us during our stay. The customer service felt customized and meticulous without being intrusive. They made our experience so wonderful, we extended our stay at the property by a day. All of our interactions with the front desk staff were excellent.

We also visited the spa during our stay. Kris walked us through the whole facility and was extremely kind. She was another stand out during our visit.

We were not without a few hiccups - The phones were rarely answered after long ring times, and when they were most of the time, we were hung up on. Phone service is very poor. Fortunately, we were able to go by the front desk and the staff there was always super helpful. It just would have been nice to not have to go to the front desk every time we needed something. Eventually, they shared a text service they offer, and I would recommend using it for small service requests during your stay. We used it when the battery in our TV remote control died and they dispatched someone right away.

The pool was a little lightly staffed (one waitress for the whole Nobu Pool both days), and the hostess was a bit dishonest when discussing gratuities. As I was closing my tab the first day, I asked if gratuity was included, and she said only 10%, so I tipped more. Upon reviewing my emailed receipt, this was essentially a lie. 20% (maybe a bit more?) was already added to the bill. I could've got it, in fairness, but the iPad in the bright sun made reading the charges difficult, and again, she shouldn't be dishonest. 

The room was beautiful, but there were stains on some of the furniture, though daily housekeeping was immaculate, and our interactions with housekeeping staff we always excellent.

We will stay again, and let David and Chemise know we are coming!",The best value I have found on Miami Beach

The room was beyond our expectations, with all the facilities needed from AC to a microwave, a small convenience store is less than 5 minutes walk away to get provisions needed for drinks and a few snacks.  The beds were the most comfortable that we have stayed in for a very long time and were very much appreciated following a fairly chaotic trip from Honduras.  Lots of bathroom freebies and a great shower added to the comfort of of our stay.  

The room had been cleaned to a high standard when we entered it although we were a little frustrated that the beds werent made or towels changed on a daily basis but this could be due to our understanding of the accommodation we booked and not a fault of the hotel.

On check out we were able to store our luggage securely, we were issued with a ticket for our luggage and were able to take advantage of an extra few hours in South Beach before our evening flight.  This was an added bonus and really appreciated.

Staff were friendly and welcoming as well as efficient, it takes good staff to make a hotel great and both could not be faulted.

The location of the hotel was great with easy access to everything we wanted to visit and as its the second road back from the beach it is easily accessible for Ubers or taxis to get around.  

However the location was fairly noisy with the revving of high performance cars and bikes that we presumed had been hired by those on Spring Break.  

Spring Break isnt something we encounter in the UK so it was an experience to say the least.  If you arent familiar with Spring Break and booking to visit the States research the dates so you dont clash with what is really a party week that may spoil your experience.

The noise was less on the second couple of nights stay and so was the amount of young adults out and about so think it was the end of SB which made moving around easier and less frantic. 

We would stay at Suites on South Beach again and would recommend it for anyone looking for a great hotel in a good location.

The check in was not well organised and a crib was not available despite previous reminders and assurances. This was sorted out relatively easily. The apartment is spacious and comfortable but if you are looking for a good nights sleep - go somewhere else. It was spring break but there are tables and chairs outside the ground floor apartments and other guests sat out late at night with loud music - there is nobody front the hotel ensuring this doesn’t happen.  We weren’t given details of how to contact reception on check in and when I raised it as an observation on checking out the manager smiled and said “it’s spring break”. We didn’t know it was spring break when this was booked months ago but as a separate note I would say anyone with families avoid Miami Beach during spring break - groups of people walking about not letting you past with a stroller.

We arrived early before check-in, and William made sure we had a room . During our stay, many interactions with Chris and William made our one night sleepover extra perfect.  I always stay here, and they both remember me, which makes for a feeling of home away from home.  This fabulous boutique hotel has the location worthy of 5 stars 🌟 for sure.

William was equally as nice and offered to personally take our bags to the room, and offered advice for breakfast while we waited for our room. 

The room was very clean. Only complaint was I killed about 4 spiders. Not their fault. Also a chain on the back door would’ve been nice for extra security. Loved the endless amount of cable channels too. The room has a weird little open closet area. If I was the owner, I would make it into a sit down lighted vanity room, that would sell huge in south beach. ",Found our new South Beach Hotel

Customer service was outstanding.   The front desk clerk name was Aaron. She was cool down to earth and very helpful.  I am the type that ask a million question and she answered them with a beautiful smile each and every time.   She suggested places we should visit and eat.    I picked the suites to stay at the last minute so I went in to this entire trip praying everything would be ok.  It was exceptional.   The suites were gated with tall gates with security codes.  I appreciated that for it is right on the busy strip.       The non smoking suite was well kept on the outside with bright lights.   The Landscaping was beautiful to look at along with the comfortable patio chairs right outside of your door.   One minor minor minor detail is that the bed was right by the front door BUT it did NOT matter because the entire time we heard nothing from either of our neighbors. (Bed was soooooo comfy by the way.   A little too comfortable I didn’t want to get out of it).   The smart TV was about 50inches or more with all the apps you would need for a rainy day. ( which we had). So if you are looking to be front and center of the action without the noise this is definitely your place to be.   You have a 24 hour Walgreens right at the corner.    It surely helped to stock the full size refrigerator for the late night munchies.   If and when I go back I want to stay here for sure. Unfortunately I only have a video of the Suites and not still pictures.  :(",Last Minute (weekend) Birthday Getwaway

This is not a hotel with a restaurant, pool and patio - but you'd pay way much more for those and who needs a restaurant in the hotel when there's close to 200 restaurants nearby? And who needs a pool when the beach and warm ocean is 1 block away?
So if the resort-hotel is not what you're seeking, this is a very good option.

Table was very sticky when we first arrived, I wiped it down myself.

The front door of the hotel is through an Italian restaurant (which is awesome, by the way).
  Pedro checked me in. I extended my trip so I had back to back reservations. Pedro fixed it so I can do everything just once, not have to check in again, or change rooms, which I am forever grateful. (I HATE changing rooms).
    The pictures on here don't do the place justice. The rooms are so nice, big, and comfortable.  I LOVED having a suite. The kitchenette has a fridge, microwave, flatware and plates. So it's good to re-heat food, but not to cook from scratch.
  The area is right in the heart of party central, which can be fun, but I came right at the tail end of spring break. So it can be fun, but also can be dangerous if you're not careful.  I never felt unsafe,
   The hotel is a block away from the beach.  With your room you get 2 lounge chairs. But all the rest (umbrellas, etc.) are extra. The Bouchon Brothers (company that rents the chairs) has a team captain who really acted like he couldn't be bothered with people. His attitude kept me away from getting any more chairs, and just laying on my towel.
   Usually the hotel itself is pretty nice, but late at night (especially on the weekends), you hear drunk people screaming, cars revving their engines, or loud ""thump thump"" music coming from somewhere. If you're looking for a quiet getaway, this area may not be for you. Further north might be your speed.
   Because of the covid, they don't offer daily housekeeping. But if you need something just ask. Which was totally fine by me.
   Most of the hotel noise came from the hallway, which mostly had families with kids. But my last night there, I thought Wrestlemania was going on in the room above me. Constant thumping, stomping on the floor, everything you could think of. I thought it was a family with toddlers, but apparently they were 4 girls, maybe high school or college. Mmmmm, great. 
    Checking out was easy. I had a later flight, so they let me check my bags and walk around until I was able to take the bus back.  
   Despite the spring break craziness, I was able to really enjoy my sweet suite!  Thank you, Pedro, for making my stay comfortable.",Right in the Heart of EVERYTHING!!

We got some food as well from the kitchen while near the pool and it was great. Just took a little while and they comped it for us because of the wait. 

The one gripe I had was how loud the music was. I wish that was advertised a bit more clearly that there was a DJ at the pool every day. We were looking for a quieter experience. It wasn't the end of the world as our room was far enough away from the pool area but the bass does travel and it would have been nice to lay by the pool in a bit more of a relaxing atmosphere. We booked a bit late and maybe i missed it somewhere but it would be helpful if that was listed on the 'events'.  We checked ahead of time and found nothing. 

Wifi was a bit unreliable which i only noticed because I had to work from the room while my wife explored the area. 

I'd recommend it for a younger crowd looking cut loose to have a great time. The location is awesome and there's a ton of great restaurants and bars nearby. You're right near the beach as well. 
",Nice place to launch a high energy Miami vacation

The hotel itself is a fun vibe, great location in South Beach by so many wonderful restaurants and I liked that I didn't feel like one of these huge resorts.

As longtime visitors to South Beach, we have stayed in nearly half the hotels there, but were never quite satisfied until we finally found it -- one that actually exceeded our expectations. Our lavish king suite (all of the accommodations are multi-room) was eminently comfortable and remarkably spacious, including a vast living room equipped with a pull-out sofa, full fridge and freezer, and microwave. The large swimming pool was well-heated, inviting, and almost never overcrowded. The location, directly on the beach and only half a block from the outdoor cafes and shops on lively Lincoln Road, could simply not be beat. But best of all -- and the key to truly making our stay a restful delight -- was the incomparably upbeat, kind, and keenly attentive staff, including bartender Vito (what a sweetheart!) at the pool, Delroy at the door, cheery waitress Muchi, Melody at the front desk, and charming young general manager Jordan Gvili, who often greeted us graciously and warmly. We also highly recommend the luscious frozen pina coladas served poolside in fresh coconut shells, although the Sagamore is not a wild singles scene by any means. The other guests were all pleasant and civilized, and families with babies, toddlers, and young children were prevalent and clearly felt welcome on the premises. Add it all together and you have a perfect recipe for a restful stay. We plan to book for same time next year, and could not recommend it more highly. Wish we were still there now!",Our Longtime Favorite Hotel on South Beach!

We were traveling with our toddler son, and required a version of a suite so he'd have a quiet place to sleep that could be closed off, which is why we chose this hotel. One thing that upset me straight away is three days before we were set to arrive, I noticed that the hotel's rates for the exact same suite for the exact same dates were now approx. $1000 cheaper total than when I had reserved a month prior. I emailed back and forth several times with their front desk asking for a simple rate adjustment and they kept giving me the runaround (different answers each time I replied). I was well within the three day requirement to cancel, and when I tried to do so and just re-book at the better rate, they stopped responding. I want to preface this review by saying by and large, the staff here were some of the friendliest I've ever seen in 9 years of going to Miami for trips, ESPECIALLY the bellhops who couldn't have been more amazing (always opening the door, greeting us, being pro-active about getting our bas, being sweet to our son....A+++ to them!). As other have stated, the rooms here look NOTHING like the photos online. I'd be as brazen to say they verge on the line of being down-right unethical in their representation. They must have styled one or two suites for website photos, because what we saw were outdated with little to no color and mismatched, super cheap furniture. The pocket doors to divide the bedroom and living room are frosted glass, so it was hard to make the room dark for our son to sleep. I had called ahead and confirmed to get a crib, so when we got there, Marvin at the front said it was, indeed, in the room. It was not. We were told it was on its way, which didn't happen. We went out and he acted completely surprised it wasn't there, but it was brought up by the time we came back from the pool. Here are a few of our biggest issues with The Sagamore:
1. Wifi is absolutely DREADFUL. In 2023, there is no reason to have such spotty service. Even the servers by the pool agreed it was pitiful as they have issues putting in orders on their handheld devices. It cut in and out constantly, which made getting some work done challenging. Of course, as with other issues, the front desk acted surprised each time it was brought up.
2. I know most people don't care about TV when on vacation, but our unique jobs make some viewing a necessity. Several of the main network channels had no audio the entire time we were there. We brought it up on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday—again, each time, the front desk acted like it was the first time hearing about it. We were even told via text, ""it would be escalated to the owner"" (whatever that means). It was soon clear this is a permanent issue that they just kept passing the buck on. 
3. Thermostat in the room would constantly change on its own. I'd wake up in the middle of the night hot and surprised to see it had gone from 68 preset to 71. 
4. Pool area was not at all enjoyable. The water is warmer than a typical bath. Gross! Not at all relaxing or refreshing. It's also a super tiny pool. Music around the pool was good, though. While they were nice, I did find the employees around the pool to be a tad less proactive than other resorts (you have to put your own towels on the chairs, move the umbrella, actually hunt out a server for food/drink, etc.). However, I will say they have WAY more options for food than other nearby properties. Their cocktails were pretty bad, though. We ordered several and they had no ice in them at all. 
5. We also found it bizarre there was no place to sit and order a hot breakfast each day. Although, later in the week, we noticed the poolside restaurant may have had breakfast, but I'm confused about exactly where/how. 
Again, we 100% would not stay here again. It was WAY overpriced for what you get.",Such a very tired property that looks nothing like online

Family oriented, rooms were clean and personnel always made sure we had a comfortable stay!
Beach service was great. 
The only improvement I can suggest is having few more people at the pool area to take orders and deliver food. Both guys that worked the bar during our stay were amazing. They were very busy taking orders and making drinks. 
But the girl was just standing around… So our food stood for 20 min at the bar and my kids just went and got it.  That’s the only improvement needed to be made! 
Delroy is always so helpful!! He helped us with our bags from our room to the car! He makes you feel like an old friend. 
Overall Sagamore is beautiful hotel and the heated zero entry pool is so great for the kids at any time of year!
Great location, close to everything, we felt like we didn’t even need to rent a car.

There was constantly people at the front desk complaining about their rooms (RED FLAG). I think the scariest part about this hotel was their elevators. They were jerky and took us to the wrong floors without the buttons for those floors being pressed. The elevator inspection was expired by TWO YEARS. The best part about this hotel was how close it was to the beach but it’s not worth it at all. Do yourself a favor and spend that extra money at another hotel! PLEASE do not consider staying here! LOOK AT MY PICTURES FOR PROOF!",DONT STAY HERE!!!! ROACHES AND GREEN WATER

The only reason I’m giving this hotel two stars it’s because of one of their employees   She is the only reason that I am giving it such a high rating.  

I decided to go there because of my birthday it was gonna be a wonderful, relaxing experience by the beach. However, shortly after arriving, apparently the battery on my fire detector went out so everyone minute the fire detector would make a screeching, eyepatch noise.   Contacted the front desk several times over at 4 to 5 hour. Trying to get this resolved.  Could not get any assistance. They had no solution to take care of this. And would not move me to another room.  Apparently there was no maintenance and staff at night. I don’t think the manager was ever called or if he was, he provided them with no solution. And they had no replacement batteries on site.  Initially, the front desk representative would not even provide me with a ladder or steptool to take out the defective battery.  Even though I offered to do the replacement myself, I seem to not get any assistance until the overnight person came on site.  She was able to provide me with a stool.    And in the middle of the night, I was able to find a store to go out and purchase a battery myself. I was been able to replace it and stop the beeping and eventually I got to sleep about 2:30 in the morning.  

I provided the front desk with a receipt of my purchase, and they said they provide it to the manager with the expectation of a refund 

I have yet to receive any communication directly from the manager even after multiple requests. And have yet to receive any form of credit especially for the purchase of the battery that I installed myself during the middle of the night so I was able to get to sleep.  

I honestly could not in good faith recommend this place.",No sleep or service.

The “hotel” was part of a cruise package that we booked, otherwise there is absolutely no way we would have even crossed the threshold. The place was (to put it politely) extremely tired. The lift (elevator) was dark, dingy, smelly, filthy & creaky. The corridors equally dark & dingy. Our room was surprisingly clean, but rather small. However, we reported the fact that our shower had no hot water as we left for breakfast. Upon our return at 5pm, nothing had been done about it. We went down to the foyer and reported it again. This time, two different “maintenance guys” were sent. It took them approximately an hour and a half to fix it. Why was this not done whilst we were out ? 
This has to be one of the worst places to stay in Florida, never mind Miami ! 

Following this Tripadvisor review, I will be sending an email to our cruise company, advising them never to send any more customers to this dreadful “hotel”.","Appalling, don’t even consider this dreadful “hotel”."

We stayed for five days in February and unfortunately this was the worst hotel we’ve ever stayed in! We didn’t expect anything amazing as the price was lower than other hotels in the area. For the sake of a fair review I’ll make sure to list the positives!

Positives:
- The hotel is a few minutes walk from the beach 
- They provide beach towels and sun loungers on the beach (though this does not include a shade - that costa $25 per day. The guys on the beach take card which was helpful)
- Lourdes in Reception helped us out when we asked to move rooms and she seemed to sympathise with our complaints. 
- We asked to change rooms (cockroach was the final straw) and were lucky there was a free room
- Comfy bed
- Some lovely restaurants just down the road. One Mexican in the Generator hotel (which we looked at online - similar price as Red so check that out if you’re looking for somewhere to stay!) Another called The Tavern, who do lovely food and amazing frozen cocktails! Crema is a short walk away, who do a lovely breakfast! 
- Bus stops, Trolley stops and CitiBikes very close by for easy access to south and north beach. Worth noting that whilst it’s called ‘Red South Beach’, this is definitely mid beach not south! 

Negatives:
- Cockroaches in our room…!
- My husbands wedding ring vanished from our room after he left it on the bedside table. We’re absolutely gutted about this and asked every day for help checking cctv/speaking to cleaning staff and security etc and not a single member of staff was interested in helping us 
- A very loud air con unit in our first room - too noisy so had to turn it off at night which meant sleeping in a very hot room! Our second room had built in aircon which couldn’t be turned off and was still ridiculously noisy. If we didn’t have earplugs, we would’ve had no sleep!
- Rooms not cleaned properly - lots of dust, stains etc and we even found old bits of food from previous guests on the floor 
- The water pressure on the fourth floor made it difficult to wash hands, let alone have a good shower.
- The shower got to lukewarm at best - no hot water 
- Furniture was basically falling apart. Wardrobe door hanging off, random bits of carpet in the hallway 
- The fridge in our second room was tucked into a wardrobe so didn’t have room to open! 
- We asked the hotel to book a taxi for our trip back to the airport. They tried three times and no taxi turned up. We got an Uber to avoid being late for our flight and would advise arranging your own transport! 
- No restaurant. This didn’t bother us as we wouldn’t have dared risk eating in this hotel if they did offer food, but worth knowing if you’re expecting something!
- Every time we spoke to reception, there were other guests making complaints about various things. Sadly, staff seemed to be quite stressed by this and we witnessed staff snapping/shouting at other guests who were making reasonable requests/complaints. ",Strongly advise against staying here!!

If you read them they are suspiciously similar! Yes it is in a great position but it is the only good thing I can say about it. The first thing we noticed when we entered our first room was a large extremely noisy aircon unit by the window. There had been a plastic strip added down the side of the open window for the pipe outlet therefore also noise from outside coming in. Because of this the venetian blinds didn't fit and were all broken and people could see in underneath. There was a seating area with people looking in opposite! We asked to change rooms and the next one was slightly better and we were so tired just wanted to sleep. This also proved impossible because the aircon unit in this room was also extremely loud and the controller was broken so we couldn't turn it off. The next day maintenance had to disable it from somewhere outside the room so although quiet the next night was very humid in the room. The room was also very poorly maintained and not clean. The skirting boards were falling off and the carpet was ruched up. The woodwork was damp and warped. The TV didn't work and the Wi-fi rarely. We saw several other people in reception complaining and when we saw other people in the lifts they were all saying how awful it was. The hotel smells very strongly of drugs.,Awful

My overall stay was great and I would definitely stay again ,  however ,I have a couple negative comments.  In their write up they really push how great the restaurant is.  THE RESTAURANT IS CLOSED!  That needs to be updated immediately.  They list an alarm clock as provided. It is not.  Being old school, I needed and asked for an alarm clock as listed.  I was promised a wake up call instead.  I asked for a wake up call two different times and both times did not receive it. Otherwise, the room was exactly as pictured and clean,. The staff was pleasant, and the location was great,  Bus went right by the front door,  Beach was a short walk across the street.  The pool was clean and well tended.

I booked through Beds on Line which is a site for Canadian Travel agents. No where did it mention a ""resort fee"". I was told that the agent should have told me about it. I am the agent! When I got home, I checked all the paperwork and read all the small print. No mention of ""resort fee"". On top of that, there is a notice that ""due to the pandemic"" there will only be maid service if you ask for it. Funny, no maid service is the only pandemic protecol in effect. This hotel is very old and they have done a very superficial update. The hallway is lumpy. They just laid a carpet over the damaged floor! The rooms are tiny and the air conditioning failed both nights I stayed there. When we were trying to check in, the clerk kept walking away from us to microwave food for people walking up to the desk. Don't book tours with them. The tours are the ones you can book on Expedia, they just add $20 to the price. Save the money and book it yourself. There are lots of hotels on Miami Beach.

We stayed here for one night and were super impressed. I believe it is brand new. It has a very cool vibe - Lots of really cool fun touches throughout the hotel and your greeted with some fun free gifts. There’s a nice bar right in the middle of the lobby. It’s in an excellent location right in the heart of South Beach. We only went to the outdoor pool on the 2nd floor (which was really nice – lots of sunshine) but I think they said there was also a rooftop pool. There was a nice restaurant on the 2nd floor too but we didn’t have time to check it out. The actual room was tiny with very few amenities but it was very clean and cozy. Would definitely stay here again!",Very Fun Stay

We stay in South Beach about 3-4 times a year and enjoyed this location, the food and the pool.
The décor was fun!
The room we were in was a bit small, we had a king room.
It would be nice to have slightly more space to be able to easily have two suit cases out,
but understand the room size is already set. Maybe ask for another luggage rack if you have more than one large suit case. 
Friendly staff and we were able to get an early check-in.
We will stay there again and recommend to friends.
We also loved the ""ice"" bag and the make-up remover wipes, so cute! Great food and pool, too and location is awesome!

Don’t stay here!   
Third Moxy I’ve stayed at.  Two were great. South Beach does not live up to the definition of hospitality. This one has loud outdoor music and drums until 11pm, I had a 6am flight. I asked the front desk if I could move, no rooms.  I asked the front desk if I could check out to get sleep, you’ll be fully charged.  
I inquired with Marriott and Angie the Front Office Manager.  She gave me half my points back not all of them.  I asked for all of them back, and she says I used the room. Well you and your team would not let me leave without having me pay for this room and another.  
I’ve worked in hospitality for twenty years, and the lack of professionalism and guest SERVICE  is a slap in the face of the greats of hospitality like Bill Marriott.

If you’re going to Miami, one of the best places to stay is in South Beach. With this hotel, you’re paying for the location and scene. 

Yes, the rooms are small. Don’t go with someone you’re not very comfortable with. But the hotel taco bar is delicious, and the the location is walkable to the beach, boardwalk, and fun bars and restaurants. 

Someone told me that South Beach is getting less safe but it didn’t feel unsafe in this area at all honestly.  

I recommend this hotel if you’re staying by yourself, with someone you feel very comfortable with, especially if you’re planning to spend more time enjoying Miami than in the room itself. 

The hotel is making the most of it and the staff is kind, so have fun and enjoy your time. And get a taco or burrito there, for real. ",Small but fun South Beach spot

Pro: location is good, amazing comfortable soft bed and good shower. Nice sized pool with lots of sun and nice views from the rooftop. They let us use the pool for the rest of the day after checkout. Staff was friendly and always available.
Con: We booked a city view but got the concrete wall view instead. Room is small, alright if you are slim and travel light but no room to unpack clothes, store suitcases or sit down to tie your shoelaces.
Tip for the hotel: we appreciate the gesture of serving your guests a welcome prosecco. However, serving it in a plastic cup (?) and then having the bartender just tell us “NO” when we asked if he would serve it in a glass made us not want to have other drinks with said bartender or at the bar again. You don’t have to be a sommelier to know you can’t enjoy a prosecco out of a plastic cup.

I've stayed in several Moxy properties. This one is particularly great. First off, it's in the heart of South Beach, very conveniently located to the beach (1.5 blocks), restaurants, shopping and clubs. The pool deck -- and even moreso -- the roof deck are amazing amenities. The roof deck is huge with multiple seating areas and a plunge pool -- all with ocean views on one side and bay/sunset views on the other. As with all Moxy properties, the rooms aren't huge and don't have a desk or seating area, so if you're coming for business, just be prepared to use one of the many public areas in the hotel.

I and my wife - who used to work for Starwood’s Preferred Guest rewards program including mystery shopping hotel brands - 100 percent agree with the other negative reviews on this property.
This is a $700/night hotel with cartoonishly  small rooms and a front desk staff and manager that seem more interested in projecting a cool, hip vibe  then treating their guests with courtesy and kindness. 
If you are a Marriott member accustomed to how other Marriott brands - including the “Trendy  bit still does service right W” - does things - BEWARE! This boutique hotel does should not  be affiliated with the Marriott Bonvoy program - and I checked my family out 3 hours after checking in and movedwork

With limited property availability in South Beachduring New Year’s week- we picked the Moxie which had pictures of a beautiful roof top pool, a good location, and beach access (while not directly on the beach).  I booked the room on points (which was probably mistake #1)

We checked in after a rough travel experience getting there.  The check in process was uncomfortable.  I am used to “Welcome to our property, thank you for your status, insert warm smile here”.  What i got was cold - think dealing with the bouncer at the velvet rope of a NYC  hot spot. Despite the fact there were 3 people at the desk and no one else in line - i was made to feel like i was bothering my check in agent by asking questions about the property.  

After check in we saw the room which was supposed to accommodate 4.  This is the one me of the smallest hotel rooms i have ever been in. There is no desk, no drawers, no chair and no closet.  You have cubbies under the bed (kind of), and a metal thing to put a couple of hangers on.  There is certainly not room for luggage.  And the room like a lot of places in Miami has no heat so it was freezing cold on this Dec day.

We dropped the bags off and decided to go out for lunch. On the way out my wife asked some questions and was treated rudely 
When asking some questions. She ended up speaking with the manager.  At that point i called Marriott, and found another property in South Beach to check in to.  Marriott said they would work with the Moxy to check me out, release the points, and check me in.   The process to release the points from the Moxy took too long and in that > 45 min process we lost the room at the other hotel. So we will spend our vacation in a downtown Miami hotel vs South Beach. While we are disappointed to not be in South Beach, and frustrated at the Moxy for adding insult to injury, our new hotel has great rooms and treats us the way Marriott members should be treated, and we are grateful for that.",Terrible Attitudes and Tiny Rooms at the Moxy South Beach

This was my first time staying at the Moxy and let me tell you, it was beyond my expectations. From the minute I checked in to the minute I checked out. They made me feel like I was home. We got there early The front desk was so nice to take our bags and let us change and start enjoying the pool until our room was available. 

Emily at the pool she’s a rock star! She was so attentive made sure we had water, made sure our drinks  were cold, she even came and checked on us. Because we took the 5am flight so we were tired so we passed out. She even checked to see if our room was ready as well. She’s amazing. 

Then that’s when we met Facundo-Franco this man needs a raise. He went above and beyond with any little thing we needed. But not to mention he’s not only the bell man but in other days he’s a server in the restaurant he does it all. 
 
The room was nice and cozy. House keeping made sure our room was cleaned everyday. 
I recommend this hotel to everyone!!!  Thank you to the front desk as well. I believe his name was Pablo he wore glasses and I believe her name was Leslie I hope it was but they were all sweet and welcoming and never said no to any of our questions.",Unbelievable and I mean it in a great way!!!

We were placed on the 1st floor where we found cockroaches on our nightstand. The hotel has refused to do anything greater than a resort fee credit. They are also not responding to messages to rectify the situation. The rooms are very small, and the scent of mustiness is borderline intolerable. Our room faced an alley of dumpsters and the windows were frosted over to block the view. We were so disappointed in how the staff have handled the complaint of the room, and finally the cockroaches crawling on the nightstand. When asked to change our rooms- they noted they were full. The expectation that we returned to our room to sleep with these bugs on the bedside table, was unfathomable to me. There were countless other problems I could outline, but again, if cockroaches did not warrant their attention to rectifying a poor client experience- I don't know what will. 
I do want to give credit to the pool area, DJ and the staff at Limonada! Do visit this establishment connected to the hotel upon your stay in South Beach.

I regret not having done more research.

The hotel itself is ok but it is definitely not 4 star.

Location is pretty good and is close enough to walk to South Beach and Ocean Drive. The reception area is pleasant enough and the staff were ok (they were a little blunt but we found a lot of people on Miami Beach to be like that). Beware that they take a $100 deposit for the minibar in your room, which should be returned within 5 working days if you don't use it. We only checked out today so I'm hoping this will be the case.

The pool was the smallest I've ever seen and always seemed to be in the shade (it's in a quadrangle within the hotel). We never went there and spent the days by the beach instead, which is only a few minutes walk away.

The restaurant and bar area looks very nice, but in the 3 days we were there we didn't see one person in there. It was dead!

The rooms were of a good size and the beds were comfy. The finish of the rooms wasn't great and definitely not what you'd see in a 4 star hotel, but everything worked just fine. There is a safe in the room but it is not secured to anything, which made it feel a little less safe! The bathroom was fine and had a decent shower.

If you're looking for somewhere cheaper close to South Beach and you only plan on showering and sleeping there then I would recommend. However, if you want a 4 star hotel and plan on staying there all day to use the pool and bar/restaurant, I would probably avoid.",Ok but definitely not a 4 star hotel

The Cons - 1) cannot walk into the lobby, must be buzzed in (a sign that the neighborhood is not good!  2) The water in hotel pool, the smallest pool in Florida was thick.

I tend to like smaller boutique hotels so based on their website I chose Clinton.  Sadly and astonishingly, the actual hotel bears NO resemblance to the website! It is very rundown and the smell of mold and must overwhelming.  It would have been totally miserable experience except for the fact that there are some extraordinary staff members who try their hardest and are so nice it was hard for me to get too mad.  Have to call out Carl at the front desk, and the head of housekeeping Laura.  Wish I knew all the  names at Limonada, they took good care of us, we hosted a family gathering in pool area patio,  Now that is another issue I have to mention--  somehow we are shared a ""resort fee"" for what is essentially a restaurant space.  There are very few places to sit and relax by the ""pool,"" which is more of a foot bath. The resort fee is for a towel to take to the beach.  I was told over the phone that we also get a chair once at the beach with partner vendors, but that is not true.  All in all I cannot recommend Clinton, there must be something better for $300+ a night, but I don't know where.

The TV in our room didn’t work, the food in the restaurant lacked flavor and the service was subpar. The noise from the garbage truck in the alley was our alarm clock every morning. And people yelling in the hallway every night was unbearable as well. The walls are very thin!!!

Now the room was very clean. I could smell the bleach. I didn’t demand a better room because I was worried with Covid we wouldn’t get a thoroughly cleaned room or one with as much privacy and air. We were located outside the main area with a nice balcony. 
There was mold in the ceiling and bleach stains all over the furniture. Again it was clean but needed paint and furniture replacement.

I did not fly over 1,000 miles away to stay in a moldy, gnat infested building that smelled of mildew. My friends and I planned to relax in a space that was slightly more elevated than our own apartments. Clinton was giving Motel vibes not tropical getaway.

When I arrived no one was at the front desk and thankfully someone was exiting or else I would not have been able to enter the building. The building is locked so the receptionist is essential. Once I got in Carl returned to the front desk after socializing with his friends; one of which approached me and began to make passes at me while I was trying to check in. Carl was brief, told me the room number and gave me my key after swiping my card for incidentals. He was preoccupied and when I inquired about a different floor it appeared to be a burden to him. He left briefly came back and checked but the hotel was too full. I waited for my other friend to come. Once I saw her Uber arrived I went to the hotel entrance door and there she was stranded with her luggage. Carl again was NOT at the front desk. When she entered the room she was just as appalled as me but our third friend's husband booked the room so we didn't want to step on toes. Once my third friend arrived she also was not happy and her husband understood. The next day we checked out and checked into the beautiful and overly accommodating Hotel Greystone which I highly recommend. Upon check out, the hotel only agreed to refund my friend's husband for the 1 night left on the reservation and not the night we stayed despite our diplomacy and dissatisfaction.

Two days ago, I called to attempt to negotiate a refund for the $85 that was charged to my card for incidentals. Carl picked up and explained they never agreed to refund us for the night we stayed and I will NOT be getting a refund for incidentals without any explanation. He did not offer any other remedy nor apologize. Instead he got loud and repeated to speak over me at which point I ended the call.

The building is dumb - I killed 3 gnats in one night. The lamp was stained and room smelled. This hotel needs to be renovated. Carl needs to be fired for so many reasons. I tried to work with the staff for a refund and be on my way but it is best the public knows as I wish my friends and I did so we could have made suggestions to friend's hubby before booking! I highly recommend Hotel Greystone & The goodtime Hotel - both on South Beach.",HORRIBLE!!!

It's a horrible sound moving about and makes you feel very uncomfortable. Hotel is very old so has a very old air conditioning system and plumbing. 

We had a room with a view of Ocean Drive to start with which was a nice view but very noisy due to thin old windows. However on our second day at the hotel, we flushed the toilet and a pipe at the back of the toilet burst and flooded the bathroom. We called reception with urgency and they said 'can you put some towels down'. We said we didn't think they understood, that we'd put all of the towels down but that the water was continuing to flood. The water flowed over the towels and into our room and the hotel corridor. We called reception again and were told they could give us some extra towels at reception and that there was a plunger at the end of the corridor. 

I went to reception who gave me two beach towels and said that's all they had. I asked if someone could come and help as the room was flooded and they said 'we don't have anyone on maintenance today, but we can give you a mop and move you rooms...' 

We ended up trying to mop up all the corridors toilet water ourselves with towels before moving rooms. It was really upsetting that nobody came to help us. 

Another issue with the hotel is the lack of parking. On booking.com it says parking available on site/nearby at a cost. The valet company is not connected to the hotel but important to know if you're staying here and have a  decided to park with the valet out front and were told it was being parked on site and would cost $120 for 3 nights parking. We agreed for convenience. When going on a boat tour of miami on our 3rd day, we were picked up from a neighbouring street and spotted our car parked on the street. We were fuming and went to the car and noticed not only was it parked on the street when told it was on site and off road but they hadn't paid parking for it and it had a parking fine! We approached the valet and they said they'd pay the fine and put it in the parking lot. Thankfully having moved rooms we could see now they did park it on-site after 2 days of it having been left in the road. When collecting our car, the valet said he'd paid the fine. I'd taken a picture of the ticket, checked on the Miami-Dade parking fine website and he had lied and it hadnt been paid. We argued with the valet for a long while whilst he argued we had to pay the full $120 and he would pay the fine but he wasn't doing so. He then said we had to pay and then he would pay the fine. We said no as he'd already lied about parking it. He then threatened to call the police and tried to drive off with our hire car. Honestly it was awful and he was such a horrible man (Elijia or something). Thankfully another man from the company called Mitchell came and helped out with translating for his colleague and apologised for his colleague. 

This however soured our stay in Miami. Do not park your car with this company unless you want your car parked on the street and a parking fine!","Overpriced hotel, faulty plumbing and thieving valets"

Just a few interesting examples:
1) We paid for a room with two rooms (so that out child gets a separate room). We  asked to make a bed for the child in advance. Upon arrival we found that in the room for the child there was a folding sofa with an insanely old poor quality mattress, and the bed has not been made. We had to request a bed linen for this bed from the hotel managers twice. And  to make the bed ourselves,  as nobody from the hotel was willing to do it.

2) If you call reception, you simply won't get through. They just don't pick up the phone or even call back. In general, they work at the reception in a very relaxed manner, with a clear misunderstanding that improving the comfort of residents is a clear part of their work. You can see a man near retirement age at one table, and a young lady chatting nicely with him sitting at another table. And at the same time they don't pick up the phone at all.

3) If you want your room to be made up while you are on the beach (when you have a kid, it's a common request), and on the way to the beach you tell the manager downstairs about it (remember, it is impossible to get through by landline), then upon returning in an hour and a half from the beach your room will still not be cleaned . The cleaning lady will appear exactly when she wants to - while she will comment that yes, she received an instruction from the manager, but she was very busy all this time. And this story will repeat itself day after day. And exactly the same cleaning lady will keep saying about the same thing. Even there is a feeling that no one except her can appear and clean your room, when you request it.

4) After you complain to the manager about this, he/she will apologize and offer to agree on a specific time for tomorrow so that this situation does not happen again. You agree on 9.30am (although it can be inconvenient with a child to fix the time in advance). The next day, returning at 10.40am from the beach, your room will still be cleaned.

5) You come to the beach at 9 am. There's a bunch of young guys arranging sunbeds s on the beach. But no one will help you with opening of a sun tent (it is not easy to open - of course I tried it myself), since the beach officially opens at 9.30am in the morning. You will have to remind them of this at least four times.

6) If you received a package from Amazon, it will be delivered to the permanent resident building opposite. And a relaxed manager will gladly inform you about it. But it won’t lift a finger for someone to deliver your package from the building opposite to your building.

7) Yes, checking out of course here at 11 o'clock in the afternoon

Perhaps this is a great hotel for yoga and Pilates. Near the elevator, an extensive list of group activities is displayed on the screen. There is some rare hyperallergenic yoga mat in the room. But it apperently lacks the basic level of service of a five-star hotel.
",Next time I will definitely choose Ritz for this money

Check in was quick and the staff was friendly and helpful. Overall impression of the hotel was slightly surprising because the lobby is a little lackluster and dated, but there are nice amenities like a cute cafe, the spa of course, pools and beach front areas. It is also nice to have an adults only pool available by the spa if you'd like some quiet time. 

We were pleased with our room but quickly realized the bedroom circuit board was glitchy and none of the outlets or lights in the bedroom worked. The toilet in the bathroom was also not working and the door didn't close. We contacted the front desk who said they would fix everything so went out to lunch and for a long walk and came back... and things were still not working. We contacted the front desk again who didn't seem to understand the issue and said it had already been fixed (which it was not). We flagged again that we had dinner very soon and we'd prefer to just move rooms. 

We were promised that someone would come up and address the issue. Maintenance came up and reset the circuit breaker and then left. Then we realized every time we plugged anything all of the outlets in the bedroom would go out and it still seemed like the front desk didn't understand the extent of the issue (or how DANGEROUS IT IS!?). Talking sparks flying when you plug in the iron and all the lights going out. They said they would send someone up to move us and after waiting an hour we just went down to the front desk and grabbed keys for the new rooms ourselves. They continually acted like we were a nuisance and asking for something unreasonable when we made it clear we didn't care where our new room was or what it was or if it was facing an alley - we just wanted to be able to plug things in without the lights going out. It was all incredibly incredibly frustrating. 

The restaurant experience inside the hotel was also so disappointing. I was really excited to have food at a restaurant that is all part of a wellness and spa experience, but it was SO lackluster. Totally overpriced for absolutely mediocre food and it felt like nothing was seasoned. I was dousing everything in salt and pepper and hot sauce. My breakfast was possibly the saddest breakfast I've eaten of all the breakfasts I'd had - and I will say this was absolutely our mistake for not reading the reviews and feedback about the restaurant. I will say the food available at the pool and beach was much much more delightful with solid snacks items that actually felt fresh and things seemed delivered quickly. 

The cafe was a delightful amenity that also had ready to go snacks and drinks as well as smoothies, juices, coffee and non coffee drinks as well as sandwiches and such. It was so convenient to have it inside the hotel (and there is a grocery store across the street - which is extra convenient), but every single morning it seemed to have an almost borderline absurd wait. It took me 30 minutes to get my coffee on the first day and the second day I just gave up after waiting and it was faster to walk to a cafe near by - which we should have done in the first place. It just felt so convenient to stumble out of bed grab a coffee before you head out to whatever the activity of the day is. I will say the staff was always incredible nice and apologetic, it just seemed like they could never manage this rush. 

The spa and wellness and fitness services were the absolute highlight of the experience. The gym and studios are all super nice. We did a beach yoga class on our second day and it was so delightful and it seemed like all the other guests were enjoying their fitness classes and activities. The spa is area is accessible by room key so you have access to the various steam and sauna rooms, hot tub and relaxation areas which we were able to use before we had our respective treatments. The spa attendants were lovely and really making an effort to make sure everyone had what they needed. The spa tour was also 10/10. The one issue we faced is that it can get incredibly crowded. When we went to the relaxation area after the treatment check in - every single chair was full and everyone was chatting at full volume - making it completely not relaxing. It's also not fun being in a sauna with a crowd of people. 

The beach and pool amenities were also when things went absolutely awry. We had a day where we woke up particularly early and went wandering to the beach and the first floor pool, but chairs were still stacked and there were no towels around so we went to ask the front desk who said that things aren't typically set up until around 9:30 - hm okay. We went up to the pool by the spa thinking we could then just dash into the spa and dry off while we waited for the beach set up. Luckily there was someone stocking towels and chair covers at the spa pool! We were delighted thinking we could grab these the head down, but the staff member told us we couldn't remove them from the area and the downstairs pool should be set up (news flash it was not - since we just came from here). He seemed absolutely incredulous and acted like we were lying. Not wanting to cause issues or remove the towels (which look the same as all the other towels) we just sat down. Around 9:30 am we went down to the beach to enjoy the sand and the ocean and wandered to all the little booths looking for towels. We saw a staff member setting chairs up and asked if we could also get set up and he said he had just grabbed these from the pool since someone asked him and the beach wasn't set up. This all made me feel absolutely insane. I stomped over to the pool and found a nearby bin of towels and we set our chairs and pitched our umbrellas and then about 30 minutes later saw someone starting to set up the chairs. 

After some beach time we asked if we could extend our check out even by 15 or 30 minutes so we could have just a little bit of extra time to get cleaned up and explained we totally understood if they couldn't do it and then had the most patronizing experience with front desk staff telling us it was super tight and it would be really really hard to do and a burden but maybe they could make it work. I was absolutely baffled because a - sorry we can't extend check out today would have been totally fine? 

Overall an absolutely mediocre hotel experience with a blissful spa experience. The hotel is still dated even though it has been updated and while the rooms were find - I'd frankly even have accepted rooms that were not ""luxury apartments"" and just a standard nice hotel room! I do not understand how this is at an 800-1000 dollar per night price point - it just does not live up to that. I would seriously considering staying at a different hotel and visiting the spa and scheduling some treatments. I do not understand these reviews. I seriously do not. I also would have totally let it all slide if it has just been one thing, or a small thing, or an issue that had been solved, but it felt like every day was another thing that compounded on top of a bunch of other small things. Do not eat at the restaurant - just don't do it - you will be sad and there is so so much good food in Miami.",Spa Experience is Incredible - Hotel is Okay

I really missed the outside lawn classes (strength, cardio and TRX). The five days I was there there was only one cycling class offered for hotel guests.

The check in process was simple and actually made things in my opinion, alot easier than checking in at an actual front desk. The virtual front desk was very convenient and they were always quick to reply via text message. The link that they provide has everything you need. Through out the trip they would also periodically check in on you to make sure you had a good stay. The room had everything that we needed for our stay and the hotel is in a great location. Restaurants, shops, nightlife, beach, and everything else all well within walking distance. We were able to cast to the TV to watch some of our favorite shows. There were some minor issues with WiFi connectivity, but we worked past that and that didn't effect our visit. I only had a few small issues during my stay. One I would say was the amount of noise that comes from the hallway. I thought that there would be alot of city noise, but due to our rooms location, we didn't have any of that. The only noise we had was the constant conversations in the hallway (which I will never understand why people feel that is the place to do it) and the need for people to open and close their door numerous times throughout the morning. I also wish that we would have gotten one of the rooms on the outside with some sort of view, our only view was of the the windows of other rooms.

We did not get as much street noise as others may have experienced. The room did not have a balcony and was not on the street side. 

The Good 

Room size 

Space was large.  Had a one bdrm. with two queen beds, living space included vinyl futon, vinyl chair and small kitchen table with two plastic chairs, Floor was painted battleship grey surrounded by a Spanish tile 

Room location 

The hotel is located on a small pedestrian street with a couple of good restaurants. Hotel provides a card to get 15% discounts for restaurants located on the street 

Beach is located 2 blocks away. 

Reasonable price 

Decent price for the area. EST ~$139.00 per night 

The Not so Good 

No Cable TV 

Instructions was provided in the room on how to connect your personal device to the tv, but I was not successful, so we watched TV in the evening gathered around a personal laptop 

Slow Internet access 

The internet was not consistent. Frequently experienced delays while streaming on the laptop 

Furniture outdated -See Room size 

Virtual Check in process 

The hotel provided the address of the main hotel instead of the actual building where I had reserved a room.  After dragging the luggage upstairs (no elevators in the first building) I found an employee who said I was in the wrong building. The person called someone else, and they came over and helped us find the location/room. He provided instruction /and the combination to get the room key and explained how to open the doors. 

The second night we found someone standing outside the door who was also struggling to check in. We showed him how to open the box to get the envelope for the room key.  There are no names on the envelope just numbers.  Nothing is provided by the hotel to let you know which envelopes is associated with each guests The man took all the envelopes out of the box and wandered off to find his family.  If anyone tried to check in, they would have not found their keys.  

Parking 

Valet Parking is $35.00 per day. We opted to park at 16th/Washington Street, two blocks away for $20.00 per night. The parking garage does not offer in and out service like the valet. 

 

What would I do differently. 

 Pay more for a hotel on Ocean Center Drive or Collins that offered parking, tv, internet, front desk  with a slightly better location.",The Good. The  Not So Good. What I would have done differently.

First, location is absolutely perfect. It is in the core of south beach, next to public transportation (going to airport or downtown in about 25 min), two corners away from the beach, directly next to the best restaurants with highest reviews of all south beach. 
Despite the fact it is so close to everything, the rooms are surprizingly quiet, probably because many face some kind of inner courtyard, so you don't hear much from the street. Price are really low compared to the other hotels and this is probably because they removed all unnecessary things that are costly: you don't have a person in the lobby 24 /7, they don't have room service, housekeeping etc. However, if you need anything, they are incredible and will help you - they answer emails within the hour, when you arrive it takes less than 2 min to have the door open to check in, and there are plently of little things that make the stay perfect - you will have earplugs by the bed, all toileteries necessary, access to yoga mats, beach towels, etc. You can go change towels or get extra shampoo and other things yourself. They even give you a card that give you 15% off a dozen of restaurants on Espanola way. I even had a birthday cake in the room upon arrival!!! So their service is still amazing and personalised despite a virtual lobby.
The only thing to know is that their beach club is actually run by another company, and the hotel arranged that you will have two chairs at the beach, but it does not include the umbrella. We did not know this and came with no money to the beach, and because we did not have 20$ to rent the umbrella, the guy from beach club removed the umbrella where we sat, so it was annoying and we would have wanted to know before. It can also become pricey if you just want to spent like one hour in morning and one in the afternoon and do activities in between to have to pay for shade (which is necessary for my poor canadian skin at +40 degrees celcius). Other than that (and beach club is actually run by another company) the stay was absolutely perfect. I recommend this hotel 100% and if i ever come back to Miami beach, it will be at Kasa El Paseo. Thank you for everything!",Amazing stay at Kasa El Paseo

OMG, what a wonderful experience.  From check-in to check-out, service was impeccable!  

El Paseo is a unique property situated between maybe 10 restaurants on Espanola Way.  My room was a beautifully appointed  one-bedroom suite with 4 Juliet balconies exposing the excitement on both Espanola Way and Drexel Avenue.  Each balcony is large enough for standing.  I loved the daytime and night life on Espanola Way.  

My suite kitchen was ready to prepare a meal that would please any gastronome.  It included a full refrigerator, stove, sink, microwave and coffee maker w/coffee. However, it didn't get used much due to the great restaurants on Espanola Way.  I did, however, make use of the microwave to heat my daily leftovers.  :)   

The bathroom is nearly as large as the bedroom.  With state of the art fixtures, plenty of towels and toiletries.  The huge closet at the entry of the bathroom housed personal robes.  What a nice touch...

I loved the living room with the leather futon and matching chair surrounding a rounded glass coffee table...perfect for entertaining yourself or your friends that reside locally.  But, I spent most of my time in the bedroom relaxing on the king bed while viewing the large mounted television.  Two balconies are in the bedroom.  I'm telling you, this was a perfect room. 

Did I mention that El Paseo's main building was an art gallery, which converted to a hotel in 2015.  I was amazed at the transformation from gallery to hotel.  

I walked to the beach on Saturday.  It's about 1.5 blocks away.  El Paseo provides beach chairs, complimentary, upon your arrival to the beach.  That was nice.  The beach towels were in the room.  There are so many shops to explore on the walk.  You don't have to leave this area for anything.  Oh, how I can't wait to return.

Khalil,  Daniel and Katherine provided outstanding customer service.  They made sure everything was in place whenever and wherever I needed help or had questions.  From assisting with luggage,  showing me around Espanola Way to calling a cab upon departure.  I felt special.   

I love El Paseo and can't wait to return.  This is the place to be in Miami!  It has just the right amount of sophistication, excitement and entertainment.  It's walking distance to the Convention Center, Jackie Gleason Theater and more, too.",Beauty and the Beach!

It did not disappoint. We spent 4 nights in mid-April in a balcony room in building 5. At first we were concerned the room was too remote from the vibe (we enjoy people watching), but actually it was was perfect.  Espanola Way was bustling and vibrant around dinner hour up until about 11 pm-midnight. But when we closed the balcony doors, we heard almost no noise at all! (Our room was closer to Plaza Espana and most of the busy restaurants were at the other end of the street). 
The room was large and comfortable - a suite with a living room area, small table and chairs, full kitchen, bathroom with shower, and separate bedroom. Clean and neat. Robes in the closet. Staff was friendly. 
On the second floor above the main lobby there was a self serve espresso machine which we used every day, and the hotel offered a complementary wine hour Sunday until Wed (I think. We left on Wed).  It was about a 10 min walk to the beach and the hotel offers free beach chairs (but we didn't use them).

Upon check in, my friend and I were greeted by the wonderful manager Khalil who  answered all of our questions and made us feel welcome. We were provided with 15% discount card to use at local restaurants and we loved every one. There was belly dancers and salsa dancing on the same street! The hotel provides FREE beach chairs, umbrellas and towels! The hotel is less than a 10 minute walk from the beach, park and has MANY restaurants in the area. We did not have a need to leave the South Beach Area. The hotel offers complimentary coffee, tea and wine which we enjoyed. Staff was friendly and helped with carrying luggage as there are no elevators. The hotel securely stored our luggage while we explored  before our departure.  The street can be a bit noisy at night but the hotel provided ear plugs and COMFORTABLE pillows and bedding which made sleeping sensational.

Owner is only interested in making money, not guest comfort! Apparently he owns the whole block with all the restaurants, and pushes early guests out into the street because there is NO LOBBY!

We arrived early, and had to drive around the block twice to find the place. It's NOT ON THE MAIN ROAD, but on a closed street, which is very confusing for Lyft and Uber drivers. Our rooms weren't ready, which is understandable at our 9:30 am arrival. Front Since NO LOBBY was offered and all the restaurants were closed at that time, we had to wander the streets for hours.

Our friends arrived at 2pm, and again NO LOBBY was offered, instead , we had to sit outside on the El Paseo Hotel owners little Monopoly of restaurants spending money to sit there. 

After checking in, and signing off to a myriad of hidden charges (35 day for valet parking although WE DID NOT HAVE A CAR,) Finally the room were ready and at that time, we were told about the ""Wine Hour"" up in the ""Library"".

Imagine our surprise when we went to the ""library"" upstairs, to discover a cozy room, with bookshelves, a coffee maker and a nice veranda that overlooked the very restaurants we'd be forced to sit at ALL AFTERNOON.

NO ELEVATOR.  We lugged our suitcases up to the 2nd floor, to discover a small CRAMPED DARK ROOM located in the BACK OF THE HOTEL. It was a cross between  a hospital room and military'  barracks.
The view of a parking lot and an overgrown palm tree. 

NO DRESSER OR DRAWERS TO UNPACK. ONLY NARROW BOOK SHELVES.

When we asked for a room with a view (after checking the website for availability, which they had) we were told,  NO. We said we would like a view, since the price is the same, and were told it would be noisy if we got a balcony. We understood that but only wanted a decent window view instead of a dark ""courtyard"".!

OUR KEYCARDS DIDN'T WORK! Yet another fiasco. I had booked the two rooms and they told us all the key cards were for one room, not the other? Who does that?  The key cards in our folder should have been set to the room were were in, not the other room our friends were in. 

Our friends flew in from Denver, leaving at midnight, and arrived at 2, exhausted. They had to stay outside too until the rooms were ready. When they finally got into their room, the landscapers were having a great time yelling over the leaf blowers, which was directly  outside the small window.

I said we didn't have a car, so I do not want to get charged for the $35/day valet parking, so we shall see if I was charged when we check out. 
Haven't tried the beach yet, this should be another disappointing experience based on what has transpired so far. 

Complaining did nothing, asking for a room change did nothing, being nice did nothing, getting angry did nothing. THEY SIMPLY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE COMFORT OF THEIR GUESTS. 

NEVER STAY HERE! RUN AWAY TO BETTER  HOTELS WITH A VIEW!",DO NOT BELIEVE THE PHOTOS OR THE HYPE! STAY AWAY! OWNER ONLY INTERESTED IN MAKING MONEY NOT GUEST COMFORT!

A lovely touch was the complimentary wine during happy hour,I’m sure the management regretted that as a fantastic crowd of guests made introductions and spent a great time getting to know each other over several bottles!A perfect start to our holiday.
There was limited parking but the valet parking was so convenient at $35 a day,reasonable considering the location.

In universally expensive South Beach, it is good value.  It was chosen for this trip - as in the past - for its safe and central location on Espanola Way.

As in the past, the room was spacious, clean and comfortable - the expected lodging satisfier.  The 3rd floor rear was quiet and highly recommended.  The comp coffee in the common sitting room is a very nice touch. And, the front desk staff was very obliging - courteously insistent in bringing our luggage up the 3rd floor in this elevator-less hotel.

But, this stay sadly, had the same flaw as many hotels exhibit in the past year.  The Pandemic Cost-Cutting Syndrome, as I call it, has infected the El Paseo as well.  Not the virus - the business attitude.  Specifically, they are continuing to use the virus as an excuse for NO or severely reduced and erratic room services.

Upon check-in, we were advised that normal room service was not available.  But -fresh towels would ""..be placed in our room each "". This did not happen.  To be fair, a short supply was provided once during our four-night stay.

It has become obvious that this hotel is using the pandemic for an excuse to not hire replacement housekeeping staff following illness and normal attrition losses.  The nation is now past a critical labor shortage.  This hotel, as many around the U.S., is now using the virus as an excuse to curtail labor costs.

All of the 6 daily itemized charges appeared on our final bill: Room-Taxable, Resort fee, State Sales Tax (twice), Tax-Room (twice). But service - Poor.  If they want to cut staff, don't continue to charge double and triple the room price for a weekend stay.","Good lodging value, but even basic room service is non-existent...."

Sadly we were very disappointed with what we experienced.  

Upon arrival at the reception, we checked in at the main reception only to be informed that our studio was in a building further down the road -  a bit like a an overspill car park.  

We are a family of 5 including three adult size teenagers. Our agent booked this hotel on the basis that the studio  slept 5-6. On arrival, there were only 2 double beds. We raised this directly  with the hotel and they made up a sofa bed in the very small lounge. This meant that there was nowhere to relax or store clothes. It was also not suitable for purpose as had a large dip down the middle that didn’t make for restful sleep. 

The fully equipped kitchen that was described was absolutely not so. Despite apparently being suitable for 5-6 people, there was cutlery, crockery etc for 4 people. The very small lounge also doubled up as a dining area - with 4 plastic chairs. There wasn’t a knife suitable for cutting and the oven was fitted so close to the wall that the door barely opened. 

There were also only 4 towels and 4 beach towels, another indicator that the room was intended for 4 people. 

The photos of a typical room shown online of the El Paseo are not accurate. Our studio was dark throughout, the windows looked out onto the back of another building and the air conditioning units below our window that ran all night made it very noisy also. 

In terms of location, the El Paseo is good for accessing the beach and Ocean Drive area and Espanola Way is lovely at night. 

The studio was clean and the beds made daily.

Unfortunately our overall experience of their hotel was disappointing.",Disappointing

We had a room with a balcony that overlooked Española Way, which was clutch!

When we were ready to party but remain in the comfort of our room, we just stepped out onto our balcony. If we wanted to take a stroll on the beach, we were just a few short blocks away, if we wanted to party, we were a quick Uber ride away from a myriad of SOBE hot spots, and if we wanted to grab a bite to eat, we could just walk downstairs and grab some really good Cuban food.

I mean…. This place has everything you’d want in a getaway weekend and more! I would totally recommend this hotel to anyone coming to Miami for the first or even for the 40th time, and I’m kinda a hotel snob.

He offered me one of the cabanas and I said yes right away because it accommodated my friends and I perfectly. We were then approached by a young man named jean and he was magnificent.

We enjoyed the pool and the beach on the two short days of Florida sunshine but even when the weather turned lousy, the hotel provided excellent accommodations.  The room was pristine and gorgeous; the cleaning was meticulous, and our children enjoyed the chocolate with turn down service (the maids were super sweet to the kids - they work extremely hard).  Cuban coffee in the lobby during the downpour was a nice touch, and we enjoyed a glass of champagne at night.  The concierge recommended great rainy day activities that we took advantage of using our rental car - Puttshack, an indoor mini golf venue at Brickell City Centre, shopping at the Shops at Bel Harbour, a tour of Little Havana and The Frost Science Museum (our kids were a little too old for it, but the planetarium show was nice).   Beachside service was outstanding as well.  We were able to enjoy delicious lunch on the beach on a sunny day.

The only disadvantages of our stay have been the cost of the hotel restaurants - for the price, there are better restaurants around.  Instead of spending $45/person at the overpriced buffet, we headed down the road to Paul for authentic French pastries, cafe au lait and flavorful omelets, and we took advantage of exploring the restaurants all around South Beach for dinner.  The hotel concierge made several great recommendations there as well, but we only had two meals on the hotel property.  Both were delicious but extremely expensive.  Lots of homelessness and vagrants all around the property outside, but that's part of being in any big city.

We would definitely return!  ",Excellent vacation stay

The pros - (1) great location, right on beach walk, right in center of great restaurants and nightlife, (2) great pool area, excellent staff working it, excellent food and drink poolside (tuna poke bowl and shrimp aguachile real winners), (3) very comfortable room. We had a poolside balcony room and I really liked this category. The poolside rooms flank out on either side of the pool and are in 3 story building. I hate being in a skyscraper on a beach vacation, I liked being able to use stairs or just short elevator to get to pool area, Also bed insanely comfortable, felt too soft at first, but I fell asleep instantly and woke up refreshed (4) all staff we encountered from valets to front desk to bar staff to pool staff and housekeeping were excellent. 

The con - we were there during spring break and the pool club next door was shockingly loud. It drowned out the music the Ritz was playing poolside starting every day at noon and continued well into night. Now my husband and I sleep just fine through anything so the noise didn't disturb us, but we could hear it and feel vibrations even in our room. I overheard literally dozens of people commenting on the disturbance during our stay - families in the morning at breakfast talking about their kids not being able to sleep, people poolside talking about their room locations and if they could find better placement to avoid the noise, even a few people who were working to get into other Marriott properties. I'd happily return, I can sleep through anything, but if I'd been there back when my kids were younger, I would have had a much different experience.",Right in the middle of everything (the good and the bad)

We stayed there once prior to the renovations. My problem with hotel is that it is way too crowded for a luxury hotel. We spent most of our days at a beach cabana. We tried to use the pool one day only to be told that there we no chairs available at 10am in the morning. We would need to put our name on a waitlist (2 hour wait estimation). If I wanted to fight over pool chairs, I certainly wouldn't be spending this kind of money on a hotel. I have never experienced this at any other Ritz property, even during the height of spring break. While the staff was great at the beach, I definitely will not be coming back.",Overcrowded

Though the rooms, shared spaces, pool, beach and amenities are first-rate, the excellent service really takes this hotel to the next level. 

My wife and I took our 16 month old daughter here for her first long-distance vacation. We carefully pored over hotel reviews (e.g. location, amenities, family-friendly, etc.) before finally deciding on the Ritz and we are so glad that we did. 

At check-in, bellhop Xavier brought our daughter a little RC rubber ducky to play with. Veronica at the front desk completely changed the course of entire stay with the incredible room she selected and her exceptional service and courtesy. We were off to a great start. 

The breakfast buffet was absolutely delicious and full of every option imaginable. The hostesses were always pleasant and accommodating every morning. We had a different server each day, but all were so attentive, courteous and, above all else, sweet to our little girl. Thank you all!

The pool area was the highlight of our trip. Plenty of chairs, plenty of umbrellas (though we always made sure to reserve our chairs right after breakfast). Attentive staff clear empty cups, etc. and makes sure you’re never hungry or thirsty. ALL of the staff were great but Alfredo, Jennifer, and Yoni were fantastic. Also Kelly was very helpful each morning to help us grab some chairs. Staff comes around a few times a day with complimentary juices or snacks, and everything on the pool menu was delicious. 

The beach is also wonderful, though we never spent a full day. We’d walk to the shore to collect shells and come back up to the pool a few times a day. Same setup on the beach, though—chairs, umbrellas and staff.

Also a shout out to the valet guys. We never had to wait for our car even once. It usually came around in 10 minutes or less. 

I really cannot recommend this hotel enough. We 100% plan to be back.",Excellent family-friendly hotel with even better service

Even gave us extras to make up for the issues. She was amazing. In general i think the rooms need a big refresh. The room felt very worn in, bathroom needs recaulked, furniture getting dingy, etc. I hope housekeeping gets better training on cleaning the rooms.

The pool is nice, beach area was too although I didn't find the attendants on the beach to be overly friendly.

We booked an extended room double queens with an ocean view and a rollaway.  The room was huge- space at least 900sf
However no cot.  Three women and Brendan at the desk who claimed to be the highest level mgr on staff said no can do because of fire code.  He was very rude and said best he could do was let us have a second room for $500
It was ridiculous.  
All three of us tried without success.  Then my sister, who made the arrangements went seeking someone else.  She was offered a better room with suite and a rollaway.
Once the other man, also Brendon showed her the room, she told him the suite was smaller and he agreed very nicely to see our room.  He agreed there was no reason we couldn’t have a rollaway.  We got one and still had tons of room.

It was a really disappointing to give up an hour of our vacation fighting with staff.  First Brandon was rude, disrespectful and was in no way qualified to work at a Ritz as a voice there.  There should always be class and respect to guests.

The hotel is lovely but I wouldn’t recommended or return if there is risk of this type of service

I want to note we never were rude, we just wanted what was promised and should have been treated by all staff like we were by the second Brandon",One bad apple

I've been a loyal customer at this resort for 13yrs on Spring Break w/my family. This resort is a Five Star, but the current management and W Insiders are One Stars. Go to the South Beach Ritz Carlton, Edition or Bal Harbour St Regis. I booked for three weekday nights end of March 2023. There was loud construction next door on the North side from 8am-5pm everyday. Not hammers and saws, but crazy nonstop pounding at over 125 decibels. They overcharged me, then gave me an underpaid credit for leaving to the Edition on the last night, and a 60k point compensation I don't need. The owners have hired very incompetent personnel; the front desk, W Insiders and managers. As customers, we have to start holding these resorts accountable and why I'm contesting the charges w/my Chase Bank Bonvoy Visa or suing for $3,000 justified compensation. I'm not paying $2000/night for an Oasis Suite being completely miserable. They never posted or conveyed that there was loud construction next door. I never would have stayed here. Furthermore, they wouldn't move me to the South side or credit my stay to go to another Bonvoy resort like the Ritz Carlton, nearby. 
This construction can easily go through the months of April, May and June. 

I'm not mad they didn't give me a room until 2pm at check-in when I checked in at 6am from a red eye flight from LAX, nor mad I didn't receive my Titanium welcome gift, nor mad I didn't get a room upgrade, nor mad I was overcharged from my prepaid rate, but I am mad they stuck me on the noise North side of the resort, and numerous managers never called me back or Andrew the W Insider. They just ignored all my calls and texts. 
This is why I'm suing them and will never stay there again. I was one of their best loyal customers, but their new management team is incredibly horrendous.",LIFETIME TITANIUM BONVOY MEMBER SUING W HOTEL SOUTH BEACH

The bread was too soggy not very flavorful with the seasoning, and the egg was not even completely being done. I had a all white egg omelette, which was also not very flavorful not much seasoning to it. The potatoes are simple potatoes. We had a ok time at the pool which can be very packed so either get there early or you might be waiting hours for a place to sit. We went to the beach stayed for a few hours and to got cleaned up in our room. We asked for your room to be cleaned up while we was out. When we got back we had stained sheets on our bed just nasty.

I received a ""We're sorry we didn't please you, we take this as a learning experience and hope you'll come back again"" . Just disgraceful....

""I would like to share my experience and EXTREME displeasure with my stay at W South Beach. But I will start with the highlights...

Our room was lovely and our W Insider Ashley Klassen was wonderful. She took the time to come to our room with an extra robe and slippers for our 3rd guest (though I had called the hotel ahead and requested that with a concierge prior to our arrival) and made us feel very welcomed and offered her assistance for anything.

On our final day (2/23) we finally received some excellent service from the three female servers at the pool area; they were sweet and attentive.

Now, on to EVERYTHING else that did go wrong:

On Tuesday morning we reserved our chairs at the pool. We ventured down to the beach for about an hour to stand at the ocean and sit for a drink. When we returned my bag was missing as were some of our belongings, and people were in our chairs. I panicked and immediately went to the service stand where I saw my bag jammed onto a shelf and was told, ""You only have 45 minutes until we give you chairs to other guests"". First of all, this is a policy I have never encountered at any of the other fine hotels I have stayed at in my MANY visits to South Beach. Second, this policy was never explained to us after we received our chairs and proceeded to tip our attendants. Third, Not only were some of my belongings missing, they were later found underneath the chairs, but I had also acquired other items that were not even mine within my bag. I was then told that I could be placed on a waiting list for chairs as they became available. I was livid. I immediately went to the front  desk inside and asked for a manager. I spoke with a Rachel who accompanied me to the pool and was able to secure our chairs. She stated that someone should have told us of the policy and that this would be a training issue they would reinforce. (In the subsequent days none of the attendants who set up our chairs informed us, so nothing implemented as expressed). At this point it had been an hour process, an hour of my vacation time spent in a stressful situation. Just extremely unsettling.

The pool and beach service was the absolute worst I have ever encountered. The pool personnel stand around in groups by the towel check- in or back at the left corner of the bar area and talk and ignore guests. The food and beverage service takes forever from chairs, forever to find someone to take your order, and forever to receive your order, if at all. On one of the afternoons we gave up on our guac and drinks ever arriving after and hour and canceled the order, and the beach service was pathetic. On Tuesday we gave up on the pool chairs and sat at the table at the bar area waiting for service, alerting the girl who sat us several times that we needed a server, after 30 minutes we gave up. Horrendous.

The elevator situation is absurd. On most days 3/4 elevators were out of service. I spoke with a frequent business traveler guest who said it has been like that for months of his stays there.

And this brings me to check out day. I awoke yesterday to see a bill for $9,000  in my email, knowing in my head that this was about $4-5,000 more than it should have been. I jumped out of bed at 7:00am and ran to the front desk. The gentlemen reviewed his records and told me that when I checked in I never presented my AAA card for the discounted rate I had booked, so instead of being charged $1,450 a night I was just converted to a $2,250 a night charge. Now mind you, I was never asked to present my AAA card, as is usually the case with other hotels. So instead of asking me for this it was just converted?? I was assured at that time that it would be changed back to the original rate and that I would receive a credit confirmation within the 1/2 hour. An hour came and went and I went back to the front desk and asked for a manager. I was greeted by a Ruth who attempted to change the rate and show me the breakdown of fees, which from the print outs was completely confusing. She printed out a new copy which I knew was still too much and then she said ""Oh , I forgot to change the last day"". Another printout. Then I asked if the taxes had also been modified. Another reprint. At this point in time I am still seeing over $5,000 in charges pending when in reality as I figured out, and your manager confirmed, should only be $1,300 after my initial payment in October of $4,500. I am watching my Capital One card online to see if those ""pending charges"" become charges at which time I will put an immediate dispute and hold on them. So this was how I spent my last morning of my vacation, at your understaffed front desk, begging for my bill to be accurate.""

I returned to my room in tears from the stress of our stay that had just been piling on from one issue to the next.

That you will have your very own insider. Except I’m not sure what the point is. Our insider wasn’t in. Our room was supposed to be oceanfront, except they failed to mention it was on the 4th floor and in direct view of giant palm trees. You couldn’t see the ocean at all, and all you could see was the pool. I didn’t book a pool view room I booked an ocean front. Next was the horrible noise that could be heard all day and night. The beeps from trucks backing up, horrible. We went to breakfast and they literally took our plates from us - completely full of food. Everything is so rushed. I have never been to a hotel where there is a 1 1/2 hr wait to get a chair at a pool. So we decided to walk to the beach and try to get a chair there and the only chairs facing the beach were an extra charge and the rest were packed together like sardines. I was literally in someone else conversation. Then when our spots finally opened up at the pool, it took an hour and 15 min to finally get a waiter for a drink. Then 40 min for my drinks to come.

I can confidently say this hotel is the nicest in terms of amenities, service & ambiance.

The rooms, the pool, the staff all top notch. Our pool team was amazing specifically Mackenson Jacques! Everyday he remembered our names and even brought water for our pup!

There is a huge JPM convention on the beach directly to the right of the property. Additionally, the hotel seemed to be performing repairs to the balconies, resulting in loud drilling throughout the day. 

Pros:
- Very large room
- Nice shower with Davines products 
- Great location 

Cons:
- No one at check-in told us anything about the property, daily events and offerings, etc. Due to this, we missed out on a lot.
- Our room was dirty upon entry. It hadn’t been vacuumed or mopped. There was a finger nail clipping on the bathroom counter, a contact lense by the bed on the floor and hair throughout the bathroom that was not mine. Vacuuming is so simple. I don’t understand how this was missed.
- Our first day at the pool, approximately 15 minutes after being sat, a pool attendant told us we needed to move to a different area due to an event that was taking place later that they needed to setup for. He said it was originally scheduled for 5pm but they pushed the time up to 3pm. Embarrassed to be delivering this request, he told me this sort of thing happens all the time. Basically, myself and half the guests at the pool had to pack up and relocate.
-  That evening at 1am, the hotel had two workers power wash the entire pool deck until 3am. It awoke me from my sleep and kept me up. This should have been scheduled for 8 or 9pm or early early morning. Common sense was not used here. I complained to the front desk the next morning and he acted annoyed by me. He said they wouldn’t be doing it again the following night but if they did, to let him know! Gee thanksssss!
- Food & bev is overpriced and subpar at best
- You could tell that nearly everyone that worked for this property generally didn’t care about their guests’ experience. It was a mix between a snobby and ignorant attitude. 

I couldn’t overlook almost of these items if I didn’t pay close $2k for two nights.","Nice property, great location but poor customer service"

Cons:
Room really smelled strongly of pine sol cleaner. Windows wouldn’t open so no way to get fresh air in other than propping the door open.
The walls were really really thin. Woke up at 11pm to loud, um... sounds from the adjacent room, then again at 5am. Yes, it was that loud. Good for him, though.
Truck dumpster sounds were super loud, woke up again for that. I wouldn’t say I’m a light sleeper, but the windows and walls were really thin.
Bar wasn’t open during the day, so ended up going across the street several times.
Courtyard furniture was meh. Needs to be overhauled.

Less than 10 minute walk to Ocean Drive. There is a pool and a nice rooftop setting but the pool is quite small and basically just for wading. 

Where the hotel really excels is its employees. The staff in the cafe so bubbly and positive first thing in the morning, every day. The front desk staff, particularly Jordan and Leah were nothing short of amazing throughout our stay. No matter the issue it was always a “can do” attitude with a smile on their faces. Always so accommodating and it was much appreciated. It’s one of the reason we will be staying at Greystone again on our next visit!!

I worried how I would get that smell out of my car. I actually complained to the front desk. But was told they use a 3rd party for valet.

We arrived around 2 AM after some flight delays, and Castro gave us an extremely warm welcome. He was very helpful and polite, and the team had made sure to reserve our nice King room facing north towards 20th Street. 

The view and room were great. The only knocks were that there was only a bench against the wall and no armchair or ancillary seating, but for this price and in this type of hotel, it's hot a huge surprise or downside. I liked that they had Malin & Goetz products in the shower with big pump bottles - no wasteful plastic use! I enjoyed the use of Google Chromecast on the hotel TV's seamlessly watching Netflix from my iPhone on the big screen. 

The rooftop pool deck was awesome, and the beach access is easy enough. Just cross Collins and walk to the water - less than 5 minutes. What you save being across the street from the beach can be spent on expensive drinks on the sand! 

We could have done with an extra set of towels in the room - two bath towels isn't really enough for two adults with long hair, so we wish they could have stocked us up a bit more as a default. Also, they give you two complementary bottles of boxed water on check-in, but I feel as though these should be re-stocked every day, and not an additional charge. If we're paying for four nights, why do we get the same amount of water as someone staying for only one? Seems odd....but I'm fine with tap anyway. 

Lastly, big shout out to Tonya who takes care of the complimentary coffee and pastries in the morning. She's chipper, friendly, and the coffee is excellent! Even better than coffee we would up paying for at the 1 Hotel nearby one morning.

For $300 per night, we should get more than basic.  Basic comes in the form of a tiny room outside the main building that is frankly a pretty long walk from the lobby and up and down several sets of stairs; in the room, there is no closet to speak of, but a curtain (not a door) hung over a tiny area facing the bedroom; no desk at all, no work area, no chair or any seating area, no tissues to be found anywhere, TV service that is extremely minimal in terms of channel choices (and quality); when I asked for access to a private space in the hotel with a chair to conduct a business meeting by Zoom on one occasion, I was told the hotel has no private space in which I could sit, not a single conference room or even an office where I could sit and have a Zoom meeting.  This is basic accommodations in the extreme.  On the plus side, the staff was generally pretty friendly, especially the daytime staff, with staff service trailing off in the later hours; and the restaurant was beautiful and quite good, although wildly overpriced.

Interesting, the hotel has arrangement with the club next door, Bailo, to remind them to turn down their music after 11 PM the club Bailo would comply to be a good neighbor. However, Greystone itself has a bar, with hardly anyone attending it, but had music blasting till 12 AM on a weeknight such that the entire second floor could feel the bass like you are at the bar! And yet the hotel would not curb the noise disturbance from its own bar. Therefore, if you value sleep and quiet, stay elsewhere. Because the hotel does not warn you when asked for a quiet room at reservation or at check in, and clearly lacks tact and does not care about comfort of the guests versus partying of other guests and outsiders. Good hotels figure out a compromise.

The location is also perfect. 
However, I am having a few disappointments… I booked a Courtyard Superior King but upon arrival was told that we got upgraded to a superior king which I thought odd but accepted. Now I assume that the courtyard kind overlooks the courtyard? Which is what I wanted/paid for. But this is my current view attached… it doesn’t feel like an upgrade. 
Also, the complimentary grab and go breakfast was rather disappointing. I work in upper management food service and I know the cost of food isn’t good , but croissants and danishes (which I didn’t see cause they were gone) isn’t a healthy breakfast… I’ll have to go and spend more money elsewhere to get protein, vitamins from fruits or juices, etc. 
I am very much not one to complain, but I just spent so much money on this trip just in lodging and flights only. And it was a surprise trip for my husband to celebrate our anniversary and his birthday…
I just feel a little taken advantage of by a few offers that were more like let downs. I will enjoy the rest of my stay but I will most likely be trying a different hotel during my next stay.

Gym was small but I never had a problem getting a machine. Great place to relax by day and night life at night.",Luxury

There were a few mix ups -- they never called to say room was ready, pool was way too crowded, restaurant slow -- but these are understandable. 

What is not understandable  was the atmosphere outside the hotel on Collins Ave.   We were heckled and generally made to feel uncomfortable by obnoxious, drunk spring breakers.   And then we woke up to news of a shooting down the street.  This is not hotel's fault, but I wish a hotel of the quality of the Setai had given us a heads up when we made the reservation that it was spring break and that we should expect a very loud and crowded Miami Beach.  And might want to consider a different weekend.

They advertise the hotel as ""serene"" and that is what we expected.  But at the pool, in the restaraunt and in your driveway, it was anything but.

The doorman might have been alerted to my visit because i had a suite, but he escorted me to the room and gave me a tour of the property. The hotel's website does not do justice to the property. It's really gorgeous with a beautiful interior courtyard and pool area. 
I was upgraded to the Tower rooms and I had a ocenview suite which had good wow factor. It's a good thing because I saw the room i was supposed to have in the Art Deco building and this was much better. You got to like having a bathtub right in front of your bed, and the toilet and shower on opposite sides of the room if you are in the Art Deco building with a suite, and the ""partial ocean views"" are pretty awful compared to the Tower. I liked having the northern view rather than the southern view. From 31 floors up, Miami Beach looking north from this point is beautiful.
The gym is good; it's not heavy on various exercise stations and is more toward free weights but it does have a technogym multi-use station and all the amenities you need in a gym. The spa was quite nice with relaxation and treatment rooms on the 18th floor of the tower building although I was disappointed that there was no steam room in the spa; I don't like saunas and I do like a steam room to hydrate after a flight. I hope they'll have one in their new digs when they finish the new spa.
I really liked the pool concept with 3 pools at various temperatures. I'd say most people were in the middle one at 85 degrees. It did not feel crowded at the pool which was laid out in a way to give you a tranquil feeling and they did not have loud music at the pool which was good. They have a nice setup at the beach and the beach is very nice with a lifeguard station not far away at the public beach next door.
Dinner at the Ocean Grill was excellent; I ordered lots of food and everything was great. Breakfast buffet was also excellent and probably one of the best in town; you could stay here several days and be happy with breakfast. Some of the items on the buffet were cold but if you told a waiter they would offer to bring you a hot version of that dish.
My suite was furnished really nicely with lots of places to sit; i liked the balcony furniture; air conditioning, shower and other things worked well. There were chocolates, fruits and champagne upon arrival in the room. I did not like their choice of bathroom sinks having found it hard to wash your face without sticking it and your hands into the small sink. I also did not like the bed duvets; they were hot to the touch and it was not a great night's sleep for me with them on me. I really think that in a good hotel you want a top sheet on your bed and shouldn't have to ask for it at midnight when you realize you're hot in your bed. This is definitely something they ought to consider.
The hotel was good about giving me a later checkout due to a delayed flight and I found staff uniformly friendly and professional. Elevators worked pretty well getting me to the 31st floor of the tower; they put in enough elevators to handle lots of guests and there was a convention there at the time. That's important because a lot of hotels fail on this.
Definitely this place is pricey; my suite was $2,200 for the night (although a week later without the convention being in town the rate would be considerably lower) and a salad with a piece of fish on it for lunch was $45 with tax and mandatory 20% tip at the Ocean Grill. But they are delivering good quality and the hotel has a resort feeling for a Miami Beach hotel and getting to 20th and Collins is actually a relatively convenient part of town to reach and there are plenty of amenities on the street close to the hotel. You can also walk a few blocks and reach Lincoln Road or the Convention Center. 
There are two-bedroom suites here for families in the tower section and I would return with mine. The Setai also has a hotel in Tel Aviv; i wonder if it is as good.

We hoped/expected it would be the best of the 3 hotels we stayed at (given the higher cost to stay) and we were not let down. We stayed in their ‘cheapest’ room which was a city view suite. Even at this level the room was fantastic….a large room with booth type seating under the 3  large windows, a super-king size bed that was extremely comfortable and a his and hers bathroom with a fantastic rainfall shower, well separated sinks and storage areas. All other amenities as expected, safe, fully stocked minibar, robes, ample storage and wardrobe space, flip flops and slippers. We felt very much at home.

Downstairs, the atmosphere is one of dark luxury, you know you’re experiencing the best there is. The Jaya restaurant is extraordinary….booths and tables around a low level pool with lit trees, looks amazing at night. It gets very busy at weekends as it’s the restaurant to go to so book when you arrive. 

Outside, they have another fabulous restaurant called the Ocean Grill which overlooks the beach and serves more casual fare but served in a high end way….great for lunch or dinner as the sun goes down. 

They have 3 pools, all at different temperatures and depths…a cool deep one at 75 degrees, a warmer one at chest height depth at 85 degrees and a low height 90 degree one which is ideal for kids. The service around the pool is excellent, beers, cocktails and snacks. All towels are provided and laid out for you, plenty of umbrellas as required, it’s paradise on earth.

Any downsides, no, not really…..it’s not cheap but you aren’t there for a bargain. For a visiting Brit the food is exquisite but pricey, $200 for breakfast (for us both), $300 for lunch and $400+ for dinner depending on wine choices. But you’ll feel like a million dollars.

Once at Impala, the Exterior is really nice - A few chairs & tables scattered around and then you get to the lobby. Our room was up the stairs - King Suite if I recall well (there is no mention of it on my receipt!). Anyway, the sofa bed is an absolute joke - You can feel the springs, which make it up for a very uncomfortable night, and when you pull the bed out, it is all crooked and broken in places, it looks like a sofa bed from 1950! Anyway, we had some sort of a jet tun bathtub in the bathroom - We were three people and we never managed to find the way it works! All we had was HOT water, the water was slow slow to come out that after 1 hour it was only half full, and the only way I found to get some cold water was to use a bucket and fill it up many, many times from the sink faucet and then pour the cold water into the tub!!! Forget about the ""jets"", again, no way to figure that out! Then, they knew we were three people sleeping there so we needed bed sheets and pillow and blanket for the sofa bed! We did not have anyof that! We had to dress again, go back outsiode to La Flora and wait for 10 mintues at the reception as there was no-one there!

If you are the owner of this property, I hope you find my comments helpful and can improve on them.

Without a car, I would probably give this a review of 4 or 5 stars.  First the good:

The room itself is very nice.  We have a suite, with 2 very big TVs, although we are not there to watch TV.  The bed is very comfortable, and the room has central air/heat so it's very quiet.  What our room lacks in views is made up for by being very quiet in a very bustling South Miami Beach neighborhood. Yes, I like quiet rooms.

A couple dings:  The couch was broken (I think it's a hide-a-bed mechanism), and the ice maker was broken. The shower is very nice, but confusing to operate.  

Now getting to the bad, the parking:

It's valet parking, 30 minutes off site and $30/day.  Once we got the hang of it, it was OK, you just plan for not coming and going frequently. Tt takes 30 minutes advance notice to get the car. Valet staff was polite and professional

Note:  that after talking to people, the city of Miami Beach put up special barricades that blocked off any turns on or off Collins St this year for spring break. This is not something they do every year.  Not the best, but it gets worse.

Yesterday we came back to the hotel about 6 pm, and the streets were barricaded. We drove by the one parking spot for valet and there was a car in it.  My wife called the hotel to get instructions and no one answered the phone.  It took 45 minutes to get off Collins Ave. We found a place to eat a couple miles away in a non-barricaded part of the city and had a nice meal. My wife was shaking she was so mad. I dropped my wife off on the next block and she went in to the hotel.
 
We are now getting to the 1 star part.  My wife found out that the hotel clerk parked in the one and only valet parting spot, and told my wife that we should part on 16th street, 4 blocks away!  This clerk needs to be fired,.  The next clerk got the first clerk to leave and we finally parked in the valet spot 4 hours late after our first attempt.

We found out later that we could have parted in any of the valet parking spots for the restaurant or hotels on the block.  It's the same Valet service.  It would have been nice to be told that up front.

Part 2 of the 1 star rating:  The second clerk, that was so helpful, gave me the phone number of the property management company, so I could tell them about our experience.  I tried calling that number and the mail box was full.  Major red flag.  So I'm sharing my experience here. You need to train and screen your staff.  I would be very reluctant to stay at any of their properties.",!

They also allow you to borrow beach towels. 
The hotel is no frills but clean with a very charming decor. In this COVID world there was some slight wear and tear, but nothing that would deter me from staying there again. I personally didn't go to Miami to sit around my hotel all day :). 
There's only 17 rooms or so across two floors and there is no elevator, so be sure to ask for the ground floor if you have an issue with stairs. Also, probably due to staff shortages, there was no one on site at the Impala. If you needed anything, you had to go next door to the Flora where the main desk was (e.g., extra coffee for the machine in the morning, check-in/check-out). But, like I said... we're still in COVID, plus it's a bit off-season. Not sure if it's like that year-round.

It was opened in 1940 and last November the owner spend $20 million dollars to renovate the place. Reading bad reviews made me nervous because at the time of booking, the hotel had solid ratings and price was not too outrages. I am not sure who was upset and why these reviews were written but they are not accurate. We stayed for 5 days and during that time not once we have experienced anyone being rude to customers. At the desk we were checked immediately and when I inquired on the upgrade we were offered a nice ocean view room on the high floor. The room was not big but it had a nice size walking closet – much bigger than you would get at any standard hotel. The room had a coffee maker and a small size fridge. With an upgrade we got an ocean view with a balcony and enjoyed having a cup of coffee in the morning. The room was not renovated but it was clean and it is important to us to stay in the clean room. You do have to ask for your room to be cleaned. It is a new normal in most of the hotels post pandemic, so please do not anticipate the cleaning service if you did not ask for it.
There is a coffee shop at the lobby of the hotel and you can get food/drinks at the pool. The pool area was always nicely looked after and we never had to wait to get towels neither at the pool or at the beach area. The hotel offers several poolside cabanas and they were booked by guests daily. There is a place by the pool that you can play ping pong or cornhole, or simply enjoy the sun. The access to the beach is gated and opens with a room key. At night the hotel locks the door with an access to the beach. I would assume for the security reasons. In some of the reviews I read about the construction site next door being unbearably loud, so yes there is a construction going on and some noise associated with it, but it was not distractive at all. We saw a lot of families with children at the pool, so I would say it is a family friendly resort.
There is not much going on at the hotel at night, even though they had some music playing at the lobby. I think most people like to go and explore the city of Miami and everything that Collins Avenue has to offer. There are so many good places to eat and enjoy the nightlife in the walking destination.
We rented a car at the airport, so we used the parking/valet services. I was provided with the QR code which was very convenient; by accessing a code the request for your car is being made and the text message send you stating that the request was received, approximate time of waiting and the next text will arrive in about 2 minutes before the car is ready.

The staff are pleasant and helpful. The pool is wonderful. The breakfast buffet is fantastic. While the hotel is older, the staff keep it clean and well maintained, and the signature scent is welcoming. The Valet staff are also wonderful!

The beds, however, need replaced. Our 4 person room is big enough for two queen size beds, yet the two full size beds remain and feel like they’ve been here for at least a decade. Bearable, not comfortable. The bathroom is small and would be more tolerable if the vanity weren’t nearly touching the toilet. A slightly smaller vanity would make a difference. 

Final note- replace the toilet paper holder. Cool design should be functional. The toilet paper fell off every time you touch it.","Great location, staff, and breakfast- terrible beds."

When checked into the 15th floor we went to the elevators to find one broken and we waited for quite a while to get to our room. We didn't have a long walk at the other end, as our room was backed onto the working elevator.

We then found in the room that the TV and refrigerator weren't working and worse still, we found a drawer full of filthy underwear in one of the drawers. It was pretty disgusting.

We then tried to get back downstairs but had to wait a full 15 minutes to get into an elevator - three times it arrived with staff and trolleys who never let guests in instead and let us wait. 

We told the front desk and quite frankly they couldn't have cared less. Never met our eyes, no apology and heaven forbid the offer off any sort of reparation. Pretty awful attitude all round.

We had to move rooms due the fan being so loud due to the aircon, the room we moved to was a large room but a tiny bathroom which is not acceptable of a 4 star standard more like 2 star.

The tap dripped daily and was so loud and the shower wouldn’t work but the staff didn’t seem to care. It was hanging out the wall.

The customer service at this hotel is extremely poor, it feels like the staff are doing you a favour when you request anything. 

I celebrated my special birthday in miami and at every hotel I’ve stayed in on my birthday you would receive a complimentary drink or cake, the reception staff rudely told me they don’t do anything for birthdays and to go across the road and buy a cake. I’ve never been spoken to in such a rude manner especially on my birthday in a 4 star hotel I’m staying in and it wasn’t just any birthday but a significant one. Even the diner across the road gave me a free birthday drink. 

They also put a 3k hold on my card as soon as I arrived which is quite steep considering there’s  not even a mini bar in the room.

The staff here really don’t care about  customer service and are only nice when they swipe your credit card on arrival. It’s a shame as it’s a nice hotel, location with a great pool and good value for money. ","Great location, Value for money but poor customer service"

Don’t be fooled by the pool pics. It’s not that big and half of the lounge chairs are reserved for the cabanas even if people never show up to them. So sadly you have to stair at empty chairs for the entire day lol. 

Last but not least, the STAFF. At check in we had a staff member just walk away without finishing the process. Nothing out of the ordinary was asked of her.

This has to be the worst hospitality I have ever experienced. We arrived at the hotel after dinner to check in. Upon check in, there was an issue with my reservation, where the hotel allegedly did not have a reservation from my agency. What ensued after that was a downward spiral of lack of professionalism matched with disrespect. To begin, the hotel has a nighttime supervisor named Andrea that has no experience, no hospitality training, and attitude towards guests. Our travel agency, along with the hotel partner called various times to fix the issue and make payment and she refused to accept payment. She not only refused to help, but basically lied in our face and stated that they had not called. Unfortunately for her, we had written emails and the agency on the line to prove it. She also had a night time minion, Camila, that also had no idea what she was doing and had no business dealing with the public. They both would speak in Spanish, so I wouldn’t understand, but tragically for them, I am also fluent in Spanish. To date, the hotel continues to refuse to accept payment from my agency and is threatening to charge my card for a higher amount than my reservation. This was supposed to be a fun Valentine’s Day with my husband way from our kids, and all it has been is aggravation and mistreatment. The hotel and its rooms are also in bad condition with mold smell and dirty furniture. We’ve stayed here many times in the past but this will definitely be our LAST!",Worst Hospitality Ever Experienced

The beach is gorgeous and steps away from the hotel. We were there in January so by 5pm the weather was a bit brisk at the beach. To our amazingly pleasant surprise the pool was heated!

The location is great, the lobby and other public spaces are attractive and well maintained. The bar serves great wine and food, and Jasmine was friendly and very pleasant to speak to. The Mojitos at the pool bar are fantastic.

On our pre cruise night we arrived late due to a delay to our flight from London. Check in was ok but not particularly welcoming.  We had booked a partial sea view room which turned out to be an accessible room on the 9th floor.  The safe box was not working, there was no door on the bathroom and overall, the room was shabby, dirty and in need of a makeover.

For our post cruise stay we had an issue at check in as they had no record of our reservation which was made at the same time as our first night reservation.  As a result, we had a 5-hour delay in being “granted” a room despite the numerous emails and conversations between the hotel front desk, reservations team and our TA in the UK. Overall, the reception staff were very poor and unhelpful and need service skills training. No apologies were given for their error or our inconvenience, no courtesy refreshments were offered but they appeared to make up for this by upgrading us to a sea view balcony room. This came with no chairs on the balcony and was overlooking the Aircon units.  Despite the view of the sea the room again was very shabby and dirty. The carpet and furniture were stained but at least safe was working this time. It all felt very nasty but at least we had a place to stay.

Despite the Shelborne being recommended to us I would not recommend until a number of failings in staff training and maintenance/cleaning of rooms is addressed.

Arrived here at approximately 1 PM I understand checking wasn’t till four, but ask them to call us when the rooms are available.

Coffee at restaurant $6.78….. very unfriendly and unaccommodating staff. I booked this place for the Jacuzzi. They have one but the pool is warmer. They said they were fixing it since yesterday and they said it should be warmer today. Well guess what? It’s colder than the pool again today. For the price you can stay somewhere better and have better service.

****EDIT *****
Like I promised Elisa … unfortunately this edit is NOT in their favor….JACUZZI WAS REPAIRED AGAIN… DID HEAT UP ALITTLE… other aspects of customer service lacking…. Promised LATE checkout but 2 out of 3 rooms friends were LOCKED OUT at 0900! They had to contact security to open doors! Like I said, for the hotel price point go somewhere else… I am sorry I am not that picky…..

We have stayed there 4x within the last 5 years (skipping one year in SoBe). We just love the cozy feeling of the boutique hotel which provides us with everything we need and want for a relaxing and enjoyable vacation. From the valet to the front desk to the wait staff at breakfast and pool to the housekeeping personnel, everyone makes it their mission to make your stay as successful as possible. The food at breakfast and available poolside is delicious and plentiful. Special shout outs and appreciation to hotel managers Armando, Ibrahim, Delisa and Andrea (front desk) and Anthony at the poolside restaurant. 

In addition, the Shelborne is the perfect location for SoBe as you are walking distance to Lincoln Road and a short uber drive to Espanola Way Wynwood (if you're in town on the weekends, check out Smorgasbord Miami) and Miami city centre.

We hung out a lot at the pool and inside at the drawing room before and after dinner and most of the sun filled days. 
Darian made sure we enjoyed the pool and so did Ashley. They are both bartenders at The Ocean oasis bar and also at the drawing room bar. (Great personalities)
Ashley said to mention her name that she is the one with the colored hair ha ha and there you have it.
Darian was pretty cool and he told us where to go in Wynwood and Ashley told us where to go in Brickell and we made day trips out of it.
The Shelborne Hotel in General is a really nice place to stay and we had a room on the 16th floor overlooking the ocean without a balcony which didn’t matter because we spent time in the room to just sleep and change clothes and we were either hanging out at the pool or the beach or going to a restaurant at night. 
Ashley and Darien were really a lot of fun to be with and talk to and they told us where to go in other areas other than South Beach Miami which was nice of them because we didn’t know the area that well.

Very nice interior with sufficient closet space. Indeed, the walls are very thin so you can hear your neighbors. But it wasn’t very busy, so it wasn't a problem.

I was initially placed in a room close to the electronic equipment. Especially at night one could hear a buzzing noise. After talking to the staff, I was offered another room.
The room was very clean; however, the floor could be wiped wet more often (I accidently dropped something on the floor and when cleaning it up noticed that the napkin was quite dirty).

Very quick walk to the beach, and beautiful modern rooms. There were three staff members this most recent stay who were warm, caring, helpful and willing to go out of their way. 

There isn't an obvious ice machine, and over text, I inquired about how to get ice, and the next thing I know, they are delivering it to my door!

 Both of my visits this past year, unfortunately, had neighbors with voices and TV from 3-5am each night, but it's not the fault of the mgmt.  They offer noise machines and earplugs I understand. The construction of the rooms, connecting door and wall materials lends to this, but I do not blame the wonderful people who work there. Even a TV at moderate volume next door will be very audible to the neighboring room. This is minor when considering all the positives of this hotel.

The lobby of this hotel is decorated just adorably with vintage decor, furniture, and beautiful original floors. The tables, microwave area, coffee/tea/water in lobby are wonderful.

The staff is so welcoming and gracious as well in even allowing guests who have checked out to return and use the lobby and restrooms for changing. Everything in the rooms and lobby is always very clean and lovely.

 Also, the beds are incredibly comfortable with crisp, refreshing linens. These are some of the nicest hotel team members I have ever encountered and I will continue to return.",Incredible value with modern rooms

I was looking forward to staying in the Abbey but the booking process was a complete nightmare.  I reserved a room on their website very competitive rate.  Once I had booked I was emailed to advise that I had to down load an ap before I would be able to check into the hotel. I downloaded the ap and was then told to upload passport, which I duly did,  I was then told I had to upload biometric face details so that there check in system recognised me.  Software very clunky after 4 hours of help from their customer service agent I managed to get it uploaded.  1 month later I am emailed this morning to tell me that I have to download biometrics again,  Customer service dept advised that they had fallen off their system.  I did upload again but have just been speaking to a colleague who booked the hotel,  who advised that he started getting emails from the hotel about the same issue just as he was boarding his plane in London and couldn’t resolve until he landed in Miami.  Couldn’t be bothered with the grief of potential issues so have cancelled booking and made a reservation with a slightly more expensive hotel with a traditional booking system,  feedback to the Sonder, your customer service staff are first rate,  the booking process leaves a lot to be desired.  I am a corporate travel agent and have never experienced such complexities of booking a hotel in my 30 years of working.",Review based on Booking process.

PROS: location is great (very close to the beach, there is a park across the street, close to Lincoln road and plenty of restaurants and retail shops around), the room and the premises in general are clean and the furniture in the rooms is nice and practical. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The staff was very polite and well intended.

CONS: the walls are PAPER thin, and I am not exaggerating. I could literally hear the person in the room next door breathe, snore, and other bodily noises. Maybe it was my bad luck, but on top of this, this same neighbor made phone calls at 4:30am every night/morning (I suppose he was talking to his family back home in Europe/Africa) and without fail I was woken up with the conversations and was unable to fall asleep for HOURS. The internet went out for almost an entire day (the staff was very apologetic, etc, but still...). And last but not least, the roof of the building is being redone and the constructions NOISE and shaking were unbearable during the day (the hotel did send a notice about the construction 2 days before I was due to arrive which didn't give me much time to really research another place to stay).",Pros and Cons

Let me start by talking about Mariano. As soon as I walked into the hotel's bar, Mariano greeted me with a warm smile and a friendly attitude. He made me feel right at home and took the time to recommend some of his favorite drinks on the menu.

Now, let me move on to Justin. Justin was the pool attendant at the Dream hotel, and he was absolutely fantastic. He was always willing to go the extra mile to ensure that I had everything I needed during my time by the pool. Whether it was bringing me an extra towel or making sure that my umbrella was positioned just right, Justin's attention to detail was impeccable. He was also extremely friendly and always had a smile on his face, which made my time at the pool even more enjoyable.

The rooms are clean and the rooftop pool & bar are lively. However, other aspects of our stay left the experience down. To begin with, the hotel is split between two buildings, one building has the reception below and the other has a Mexican restaurant below where guests enter and exit. Having to access the hotel through the restaurant took from the experience. On our second night the AC was not working, this was a hotel wide issue. The lift also stopped working meaning we had to use the 1st floor corridor (which was wet from the AC units leaking) and the narrow staircase. To the hotels credit they waived 2 nights resort tax because of these problems but we would have rathered having a better experience in the hotel.

I’ve stayed at The Dream Midtown so felt familiar with the brand experience. This is a hotel of a very different colour. I should have done my homework. My bad. 

The staff are amazing and do well to distract from the hotel’s failings. 

Issues include: very little soundproofing between hotel floors and the floorboards are exposed wood. Noisy. 

A mostly-party clientele who keep anti-social hours. Noisy. 

Tired decor and dark dingy rooms. Such a shame when the sun is out. 

The pool area was good, though the pool attendants were really rude. The ladies who waited the tables for the bar/restaurant were always so helpful and friendly so the juxtaposition was jarring.

Steps from the beach, restaurants, and shops. I want to give a major shout out to the two employees who helped us on our last night. Long story short, my wife’s purse fell off the bed and all her cards went under the bed. If you know how hotel beds are, it was near impossible to retrieve it. Two employees helped moved the (very heavy) bed so she could retrieve her license and we could get on our flight the next morning. They were super gracious and understanding. 

Cons: didn’t love the view out our window (of busy collins ave) but not really the hotel’s fault. Next time I’d pay more for a room on the other side. It was loud at night (to be expected) but I had no trouble sleeping with ear plugs in. Rooftop pool is kinda small.

Arrived late in evening on Fri 30th Jan and started out okay, staff were friendly and we were quickly checked in. We did have to circle the block a few times in order to stop and unload the car/hand off to the valet but understandable on a Friday in South Beach.
The receptionist explained the hotel has two buildings and we had been allocated a room in the other building (separated from reception by a courtyard) and directly above a club/bar called Naked Taco. We did extensive research before booking and nowhere on the website does it mention that some of the rooms are above a club/bar - something which would definitely have prevented me from booking but we tred to be open minded and hoped for some solid sound proofing.
The room was directly above the club/bar and two rooms down from the doubles doors which allowed access to the club/bar - these doors were never locked, meaning bar patrons were able to wander freely in the hotel corridors.
Everything was dreadful - the bed was agonising to sleep on, the sliding doors to the toilet did not meet with a gap of approx 1 inch (a rubber bumper was missing) and the biggest issues, noise was AWFUL. Absolutely zero sound proofing.
The club/bar was very loud and the noise carried on until approx. 3 am despite advertising closing at 1am. Thought we may finally get some sleep then, even with the painful bed but at 5am, banging started in the bar below again as the staff started arriving for the breakfast service - in no way were they quiet, lots of banging and crashing!! To add insult to injury, one of the staff wandered out of the afore mentioned double doors and had a long, loud conversation on her phone - walking up and down outside the room.
After this terrible night, we approached reception indicating our dissatisfaction - given that this room cost $500 per night. The receptionist gave a half hearted apology and moved our room to the main building. No compensation was offered but mainly we were keen to just have a good nights sleep, we were not looking for ""extras"". We packed up our cases and moved over, hoping for the best as the toilet doors closed and the bed did not feel like it was made from barb wire.
Later that day after a shower and nap - trying to recuperate from the sleepless night and prepare for new years eve (also our anniversary), we woke to a water leak from the air conditioning. The leak was a HUGE puddle, right in the middle room - completely unavoidable and very slippery. Maintenance took one look and said it could not be quickly resolved and we'd need to move room again. This would be our 3rd room in less than 24 hours.
Reception did not bother to apologise this time and tried to give us a room in the other building again, we refused and we was given a room on the 2nd floor of the main building where we were met with familiar issues....the toilet doors did not close and the bed was actively painful.
We asked to speak to a manager and was advised someone would be available in the morning. We had another sleepless night courtesy of the terrible bed and incessant noise from the bar - it did not close until 330/4am. 
On new years day, we were able to speak to a manager (Antz Augustin) who was the only shining star of this horror show. He was very understanding and apologetic and was (rightly) appalled at the receptionist attitude and our treatment/experience. He did his best to mitigate our experience and compensate us but sadly there is no way to make up for no sleep, stress, panful backs and lost time packing/moving rooms on our special new years anniversary. We arrived here blissed out from a week in Jamaica and left haggard and baggy eye'd.
I do expect a certain amount of noise during the evening/nights in South Beach, we have visited before. However, researching hotels with good reviews and no noise complaints should have led to a decent stay and it did not.  
The hotel website should be transparent about the potential for being issued a room directly above a bar and definitely should consider some sound proofing between floor and the halls. 
The hotel appears to have valued style over substance, it looks quite cool in the pics online but in real life was small and dark. The clock/phone charger did not work, no room to unpack etc. a myriad of small issues.
On reflection, there are a large number of positive 5* reviews for this hotel which are written by ""users"" who never wrote a review before or after the ones completed for Dream South Beach. Users who do not have a genuine photo (vague landscape pics typically), name drop specific staff, the same ones mentioned over and over. You may note, the reviews written by genuine, regular users do not routinely name drop in the way. Interesting I think and a little suspicious. 
Anyhoo, we would recommend you select any other hotel and give this one a miss - unless you want to have zero sleep and a bad back.",Worst hotel we have ever stayed in.....

We felt like we were in the right place – close to the action, but far enough to get some sleep when we were done partying.

- First when we arrived, we were charged extra mandatory 20 USD fee for every night to cover beach towels and beach chairs that we were not interested in buying, we were forced to pay the resort fee to be able to check in.

- Internet is for additional 20 USD per night! We stayed for 10 days which added 200 USD additional cost to an already awfully overpriced hotel.

- Shower - did not have pressure at all. Impossible to wash long hair. It was dripping down from the shower head. No hand-hold shower. 

- The corridor smelled like weed or cat piss.

- No water boiler in the room - no coffee, no tea in the morning.

- The worst was loud music that came from their own nightclub on the first floor. 
The glasses on the windows were vibrating and it felt like we were in the middle of the nightclub with our bed. We measured the loudness of the music in silence and it was 54 dB. That was unbearable! We wanted to move out and contacted the hotel manager but he could not care less, they had our money and they just half laughingly said that ""you already got the quietest room"". It ruined literally our stay in Miami. 

- We were handed out an info sheet that said that beach towels can be used only starting from 9 o'clock. So we waited until 9AM to take our morning swim in the sea, we get to beach and the guys on the beach said, ""No no, towels are available only from 10 AM"". We swam and went back to the hotel soaking wet, letting them know that even the simplest information they cannot get straight. 

- We went to the beach another day to use the chairs that we were forced to pay 20 USD for every single day, and then we get to know that we only chairs, the umbrella that was above every chair couple was not included and that cost additional 21 USD. What a rip-off.

- Questionable fire safety - the green EXIT sign was literally pointing into our room (nr 264)

- The light from the corridor was shining straight into our bed because the door had big cap around the door frame. We heard everything from other rooms. 

- You cannot go to the restroom in peace because it sounds like your partner is right next to you. Closing slide doors are just to cover the sight into the toilet. No privacy.

- The elevator in the hotel takes 15 seconds to move from 1st floor to 2nd floor. It is officially the slowest elevator I have ever experienced.

- The pictures about this hotel are a scam - it is unbelievable that it is allowed. It was an old worn down smelly hotel but those pictures left totally different impression. 

It is honestly the worst hotel experience I've ever had and I have traveled through the US, Europe, and recently Thailand.","Horrible, horrible, horrible!"

The property is awesome, as is the staff and everything about it (especially after seeing the hotels there are in Miami Beach). This one takes the quality leap right out of the park.
Only positive points:
1- The staff: incredibly nice! Thanks to Justin at the pool for his kindness and sympathy, and especially thanks to Carolina at the reception for her kindness and infinite availability! Caroline really at the top, thank you very much! She's really the best of all the hotel !
2- design, cleanliness and room: hotel which takes care of the detail and which is decorated with taste. big and clean room (excellent work besides celuis of the cleaning ladies who leave the room in an impeccable state)
3- LOCATION: in front of the Casuarina villa (which can be seen from the rooftop) and in the middle of Miami beach. Street parallel to Ocean Drive and with all comfort: restaurants, stores, everything!
4- Services: swimming pool in the rooftop with bar, free deckchairs on the beach with towels (beach at 6 minutes walk). just perfect!
Obviously it is the only hotel that I will choose once in Miami! without any doubt!

Did not like - just a few small remarks but nothing mean:
1- the door of the toilet (separate shower and toilet with the sink) which does not close well and a bit transparent (I know it goes with the beautiful design of the room but personally I prefer completely closed bathroom doors)
2- no breakfast possible at the hotel (with this service it would be really perfect)",Perfect holidays !

Rooms were cozy, with a large, comfortable bed, steam shower, and nice decorations. The room was clean, as were the hallways and lobby. There happened to be some kind of water leak on the ground floor that reached to the lobby when we stayed, but that, I'd assume, was a one-time issue. The issue we had with the room was the shower - the water was steaming hot regardless of how the knob was turned. We asked the front desk how to remedy the situation and they only suggested to press the button on the shower knob (which did not work). We had to take showers lasting only a few seconds before the water became dangerously hot. Also, be sure to be good friends with the folks you travel with - the bathroom and shower doors were glass and completely transparent.

Parking was expensive - the two parking lots nearby charged $20 per day (October 2022 prices), with the hotel's valet charging $42/day. Luckily, everything was in walking distance (GREAT location!), so we never had to move our car once it was in the lot. Beach chairs and towels were included in the 'resort fee', but umbrellas were an extra charge ($20). All of these extra (hidden?) fees made it a bit frustrating. We did not purchase the breakfast; instead, we went around the corner to a nice bakery (Bettant Bakery & Cafe).",Boutique hotel in a perfect location

The rooms were comfortable, the showers were good, the aircon was relatively quiet, and all areas were very clean. Staff were very efficient and friendly. The hotel is a street or two away from the main streets, so is nice and quiet, but it's very easy to walk to local shops and attractions (we didn't need a car at all during the 4 days we were there).

I have been in Miami South Beach many times and this time I would like to stay away from crowded areas at Ocean Drive, where Kimpton Palomare South Beach is a great alternative. It is a really cosy hotel with amazing service located in a relaxing area  The hotel has a great pool at the rooftop. I will com back to the Kimpton Palomar South Beach next time, I visit Miami South Beach.

Review:
I stayed 5 night at Kimpton Palomar South Beach in February. The hotel is located 30-40 min away from the airport. An Uber is about USD 30 and taxi can easy become much more expensive. 

The hotel is located in the western part of the South Beach, but the hotel offers a free shuttle to the beach, if you wanna go there. The neighborhood is very relaxing, where you also find some local restaurants, bars and shops. Lincoln Avenue is only 10 min walk away. 

I arrived late at the hotel due to a delayed flight, so the room was ready. The checkin was fast and service was really great. I also got a late check out due to a very late flight from Miami.

I have booked a room with a small balcony - the room was really great. From the balcony I had a amazing view at the sea between South Beach and Miami. The room was clean and the size of the room was ok. 

At Kimpton hotels they always has a social hour in the afternoon, where the serve red and white wine. Not many used this option at Palomar South Beach. It was possible to be seated outside in the sun during the social hour - which is from 5 pm to 6 pm.

I had breakfast at the restaurant every day. The food was really good and the service was amazing. There was 2 menus for breakfast - one for weekday and one for weekends. The restaurant was really busy in the weekend. 

The pool is located at the top of the hotel. in the afternoon there was a lot of people in and around the pool. The pool bar was open some days. When the poolbar was closed you can order food and drinks via your mobilephone, but it did not work really well. 

You can borrow bikes at the hotel. ",Great alternative to Ocean Drive.

Our room was a good size, spotlessly clean and had everything that we required.  We loved the wine hour and used it both nights of our stay. 

The location was great, close to the Lincoln Road Mall and several good restaurants.  The harbour was close by and we enjoyed walking around there.
Although we didn’t use it ourselves, we kept seeing the hotel shuttle running guests around, it seemed to run throughout the day and we were told it would take us anywhere on Miami Beach.

The hotels Italian restaurant looked very nice but was very quiet on both the nights we stayed so we ate elsewhere.  For breakfast we popped to Trader Joes which was very close by and bought juice, fruit etc and got coffee from the hotel lobby and ate on our balcony.

My only complaint was that I had paid extra for a ‘Harbour View Room’.  I quite expected to see boats bobbing about in the harbour from our balcony.  Instead our room overlooked a storage facility.  I immediately went down and queried this with reception, expecting them to say that we had been given the wrong room, only to be told that no, that was a harbour facing room.  The room did face the harbour but the view was obliterated by two large apartment blocks.  Very misleading.
Since otherwise we were happy with the room, I let it go, but if you are expecting to see the harbour, I wouldn’t bother paying extra for one of these rooms because you won’t see it.   They are however possibly a bit quieter than the ones on the other side of the building, and the balcony was useful.

Other than that, we had a very enjoyable stay.","Lovely stay, but no view of the harbour."

The pool area is nice however the cushions need to be cleaned and the bar was not open at all.

I’m 42, and we all three found many things to love! 

The great
The housekeeping staff was excellent—room was not only exquisitely clean each day, but they did sweet touches like spread our blanket from home on the bed with the younger girl’s stuffed animal resting cutely on the pillow. 

Daytime desk staff were great and the restaurant is, hands-down, the best hotel/hotel-adjacent restaurant I’ve ever dined at, both in terms of food and service. Free bikes? Yes, please! 

The roof was more expansive than photos indicated; we would’ve spent more daytime there if we’d not been out being tourists! There are a variety of places to lounge, and we had a great afternoon nap on one of the large bed loungers.

The not-terrible-but-not-great
None of the roof games were available to play, and no one was up there to ask. We’d looked forward to getting a poolside meal but, when we scanned the QR code for the menu, everything was marked “unavailable.” 

Though reviews indicate the pool is “heated,” I’d interpret that more as “pool is not ice water, but you’d never call it ‘warm.’” 

I wish we’d been offered bike helmets and a bike map (different from a regular map), but I only thought of that once we were biking and I realized it was a more daunting ride than I’d expected. 

Getting in and out of the hotel on foot is a little confusing. We ended up walking through the parking garage, either bc it was the only way or the better way wasn’t at all clear. 

Though the front desk gave us a map and explained where to get beach access, a color photo of the correct area showing the beach setup and umbrella colors would be great (even if it’s just kept at the desk) and clearer instructions would’ve been helpful. 
The hall carpet was seriously stained on our floor, which was okay but not typical of a Kimpton. 

Night and very early morning desk staff were not as helpful or knowledgeable as daytime staff. Not bad, just not as open, confident, and competent-seeming. 

We had to wake at 4am Sunday so on Saturday night asked if we could get a coffee maker in the room. They delivered, but we realized at 4am Sunday that only decaf packets were available. 

Overall I would stay there again, but only if I got a great deal again! It may be because we were there off-season, but the hotel just didn’t seem 100% up to speed on all it’s advertised perks.","Cool building, rad roof, & free bikes!"

So bad that we checked out after one night.

The front desk was friendly enough, but the real stand out was the incredibly helpful bellman.   The hallways are tight and there are a lot of turns (and not good signs) to the rooms and elevators so we were glad he helped us with our bags.  There was also an area where housekeeping was gathered with their carts all talking and laughing, they seemed like we were a burden trying to get to our room.

Upon entering the room we were very disappointed with our view, we had paid for a ""King Premium Terrace Sunset Harbour view"".  There is no water view and it was VERY LOUD.  We were on the side of a very busy intersection and it was endless hour honking at 6pm. When we went to the patio we found one of the outdoor chairs to be covered in dirt and mold.  So we went to the phone to call about switching it out and discovered our room didn't work.  

We went to the front desk and told them about our disappointment.  They tried to switch our room, but nothing was comparable to what we had paid for so we agreed that while we went to dinner that they would change out the chair. and the manager would call while we were getting ready (which he never did).

There is a restaurant next door, where you get 15% off your meal if you are a hotel guest.  We were very surprised that the Breakfast amenity is not offered to Diamond Elites and substituted with 1k points (which is not comparable).  It's tiresome hearing from the front desk things like ""we are a newer property"" and  ""because of the pandemic"".  We stay at a lot of Kimpton properties and have not encountered this before.  And on top of that this property has a steep amenity fee.  

In general the management at this property is lacking.  Staff is not properly trained (which I don't blame on them as they were nice), but they don't know to to handle customer service issues.  The rooms are not sound proof and are very deceiving in the pictures in regards to furniture and views you get.

Later the manager said he had called our room but couldn't reach us.  Of course he couldn't reach us, we were in a room with a phone that didn't work.  He had my email and cell number.  After we checked out, approx. 3 days later he reached out to me via email to ""discuss what had happened"".  

There are too many hotels in Miami that are in better locations, provide strong customer service, and do not lie to guests.","A very disappointing stay, do not recommend"

We booked our room a King Premium Terrace Sunset Harbour View. The photos online showed a waterfront view and a bed, two chairs in the room and a balcony with a table and two chairs

We checked in late and it was difficult to see outside, but there was no table in the room and no chair either. In the morning when we looked out we just saw buildings, no water view. We asked to see the manager and were told that the room wasn't in the position the King Premium Terrace Sunset Harbour Views were in because we needed an Accessible Room. However, we had booked an Accessible Room and not been told it was a problem. In addition to this, I had emailed twice to check that I had booked an Accessible Room, I was told no, but they could change it and I checked if it would be the same type of room and was told yes on at least two occasions.

In order to make up for this, they didn't charge us the Resort Fee. We had to pay for Valet Parking and we had pre-paid the hotel. We were only staying one night but due to return for 2 nights, a few days later but we cancelled this, as we were so disappointed.

I have now looked at the website, as we are Diamond Elite Members but booked this via Amex. It shows even Essential Rooms have a table and two chairs but we had nothing, so I don't believe the photos online. 

There is no restaurant in this hotel, although one next door, where you can get a discount. I have never known a Kimpton Hotel that doesn't serve breakfast. I went to Dunkin Donuts to buy breakfast.",Never been so disappointed

Had business shirts to iron and had to call for a board. Absolutely no water pressure. It was super annoying trying to take a shower. They switched us the next day to King, and while it was a much better bed, all of the other inconveniences remained the same. Close to the convention center is the best I can say.

This is an older hotel and we did have some issues with the hot water in our original room.  However, Lily resolved the issue quickly by moving us to an even nicer room with a better view (and lots of hot water).  She even sent us a bottle of sparkling wine to thank us for our patience.

I travel a lot, and make reservations on the phone directly with each hotel.  I routinely call multiple times to confirm my reservation, and to ask questions about the property.

The answers to my questions were misleading to say it politely.  I was not informed that there was some sort of huge spring break event planned by the city for South Beach, and the streets WOULD BE CLOSED.  So telling me more than once that valet parking was available was totally untrue, since you could not even drive to the hotel.  The whole story has more iterations and got worse and worse until finally the hotel  management refused to refund my cost for two rooms since getting to the hotel it was my problem, not theirs.  And if I got bad info from hotel representatives multiple times, that was my problem too and not theirs.    You would not believe the rest of the story and the bad treatment.

When we got back from the cruise we had two nights in the penthouse room which had a private swimming pool/ jacuzzi type - the only reason we booked this room was to have the private hot tub which unfortunately we couldn’t enjoy as the day we checked in, they had done some treatment to the pool and the pool water was full of foam, there was a very strong smell of chlorine, we went in to the pool but had to get out as our skin started to itch , my swimming shorts were black and they got bleached after being in the water. Complained to reception including the hotel manager, they said they would do things to fix it , even drain the hot tub but nothing was done !

Lily and Kai were excellent! Lily got us into our room earlier than the 4 p.m. check-in and they helped us find our way around. She pointed us to MamaMia, gelato and coffee place connected to hotel, which was lovely! Even the night front desk staff was great, though I never got their names. And as far as location, it was close to the beach, which is what we wanted. They offered us towels and chairs if we wanted them and we were at the beach in 5 minutes.

That is where the good experience stopped. 
1) I reserved an ocean view room (more expensive) and you can see the picture from our room, you have to look to see about an inch of the ocean. I paid extra for an ocean view and I might as well have saved my money.
2) The room carpet was damp when we got into the room. Okay, we figured they just cleaned it and it wasn't dry yet. Over that day and the next, the room got mustier and mustier and smelled of mold. It was almost unbearable when we left the 3rd morning. When they did clean, they could have something about that.
3) The maids took one of our hand towels and didn't replace it or the ""free coffee"" pods in the room. We drank 2 and they didn't replace them, nor did they replace the condiment package (creamer & sugar). 
4) The cleaning crew arrived at 9:30 a.m. on the day of our checkout - checkout is at 11!

All in all, I would definitely not stay there again.

The Breakwater and Edison hotels are one U-shaped building and you might stay in one or the other, but both are very nicely centralized to anything you wish to do in Miami Beach.  One block away there was a restaurant that played very loud music every second they were open, but in the room, you could barely hear the music.  Everything was pretty silent by midnight, so if you can last that long you will be fine.

For those that choose to run a hotel you take on that responsibility. 

Good points at The Catalina Hotel and (not) beach club are that the bar staff seemed polite and efficient. 
Everything else seemed good at first but........

From check in to departure we came across more and more issues 
- check in - we booked and paid for two king size bedded rooms, we receive one nice  king size and one tiny double we were told it was because we booked through a third party and the second room was king size but a slightly smaller king size!!
The night time patio music was horrendous if sleeping was what you were after. 
We asked about the beach club and we're given two towels as they only had two left and were informed that there is no beach club as such. 
The room lifting and broken newer floor, appalling bathroom with constantly running toilet, jammed door that couldn't be shut, rusted fittings. And the hand sink (about 9"" round) hanging off the wall. Absolutely no hanging space as it was taken up by other stuff 
There was clearly an ongoing program of Reno's but the workmanship was not even to poor DIY standards. 
At the pool - good luck in accessing emergency life saving equipment (over grown in the bushes) and not marked - the disability lift into the water has clearly not worked for a long long time and the fire extinguishers were several years out of date. Also open electrical connections in easy reach. 
The elevator has not been inspected for 2 years according to date plate.

Coming from the Northeast, I really wanted fresh air and was willing to pay a little extra. This “balcony” couldn’t even fit one of my feet, let alone my body. It faced an indoor garden with no fresh air at all!! Plus, I couldn’t even open the shade because there was another room directly across from me with their shades open. I didn’t feel safe even opening the shade so there wasn’t even any natural light. Then, my flight wasn’t until 4:30 so after check out at 11, I assumed I could leave my bag and go to the beach for a few hours. They do NOT hold bags! I’ve never heard of that, especially at the beach. So I had to lug my bags to the beach with me! If you’re traveling alone and you want a balcony, skip this hotel!",Do not pay for the balcony!

they have been more than helpful!   
They accommodated us with all our needs. and helped us book the room for 2 more days and even kept us in the same room when we did! 
Vallet parking is 25$ a day but that's better than the garage parking which is 50 a day & u have to move every 12 hours in garage  !

When we asked the front desk for another room, someone whose name begins with ""Jon"" and ends with ""than"" spent 10 minutes trying to upsell us on a suite as the ""best"" option. It took a full 10 minutes to get him to say that the room would cost DOUBLE our current rate. An apology was never said! After all that, we eventually were moved to the type of room we needed. Also, get ready to experience the life of a sardine in a can when you visit the overcrowded pool area! Service was slow all around - it took me 3 days to get a fed ex envelope.

During the check in we were told that there were no upgrades available from the next level, so if we wanted an upgrade there was one 2 levels above so we could pay the difference, we didn't do that since we were not planning to spend much time in the hotel anyways, check-in was pretty basic and rushed.
We reached our room and noticed that we didn't even have the balcony we had booked, no balcony at all, so we were actually downgraded at no cost from our original booking.
We got right away a text message from the concierge team asking if we needed anything and if everything was ok, ""great service"" we thought, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to inquire about our downgrade, we replied right away, the response came hours later that they were sorry and were going to look into it, the response never came even after a second message being sent later during the day...
Pool was extremely crowded and the fake grass around the pool heats up a lot, one of the disadvantages of using plastic around the pool, so we had to run to our chairs burning our feet or leaving our sandals next to hundreds of other sandals around the pool.
Pool service was good and drinks were ok but pricy.
We instead had a couple drinks in the bar of the hotel which is a really nice bar with great drinks, shoutout to Louis and Luciano.

Overall the only good thing was the bar of the hotel also it is not a bad location but its definitely not the service I was expecting to have from a Loews hotel.","Bad service, good location."

1. A front desk staff that is just pushing through the LONG line of guests in this 790-room hotel, not caring about accuracy.  

2. A hotel that doesn't care about the comfort of its guests. In the pool area, they pack you in right against the next chair with zero space between while in the mean time, they have taken away pool space for TWO pay areas They have clearly decided to sacrifice the comfort of the guests for additional revenue streams. This is all despite the fact in the two days I was there, a Tuesday and Wednesday the entire Pay section right up against the pool, not a single person rented anything but the pool area was absolutely packed. On our 1st day there we couldn't find a seat until 245pm. On the 2nd day, we went to the pool at 730am to grab seats before breakfast to only have a few available. When we got back 45 minutes later every chair was claimed. It was well into the late afternoon that chairs started to become available.

3. This hotel doesn't provide VIP service in any way. I booked my stay through the American Express Fine Hotel and Resorts program. I admit that from my first interaction with the hotel, I had very high hopes. The day before my stay, I received a call from the VIP department introducing themselves to me and asking if there was anything I may need during the stay. My only ask was for 2 additional pillows. They were not in the room, so that was ignored. I was also asked what time I would be arriving, I said approximately 11 am. Part of the Amex program is a 12-noon check-in when available. I use this program a lot, although most are available at the time there are times when rarely we wait at the most an hour. This room wasn't ready until about 215pm even after checking back at the desk at 1pm, 130pm, and 2pm. I understand this is not a guaranteed part of the program but waiting almost 3 hours is disappointing.

4. A staff that is not thorough in making sure of accuracy or handling situations. Upon arriving, I gave my credit card for incidentals and was given a packet to use the facilities. I went to the pool, and ordered a drink at the pool. Upon giving my name for payment I was told I was not in the system. The bartender called the front desk who also couldn't find me! He hung up and said I am not registered. A guest sitting at the bar even made a very embarrassing comment towards me. The bartender then called the manager over who repeated with the exact same result, I couldn't be found. Once again feeling embarrassed I had no other form of payment since my wallet was in my luggage at the bell desk I said I would go to the front desk. It turned out my name was listed by my middle initial for some reason. Regardless of how that happened the front desk at check in should have had that and corrected but once again I was just one of a long line of people to move through. It took them almost 20 minutes to find a manager to correct may name.

5. Don’t expect high level of housekeeping service. The hotel doesn't have a turn down service, this is the 1st hotel in the Fine Hotel and Resorts program I have ever stayed in that didn't have this service. 

There are so many hotel options in the Miami area if after reading this you are for some reason on the fence I will mention a couple of positive points. 

The food quality was above expectations. The hotel itself was extremely clean and well-maintained. These really are the only positives I can say about the hotel. 

In no way is this hotel living up to the expectations of a Fine Hotel and Resort.

The hotel is in a great location with access to tons of local eats and of course the beach.  The good: The lobby area and overall property are well maintained outside and in the common areas. The restaurant staff, Beach and pool staff, valet, bellman, and restaurant staff are great.  Everyone made us feel like family and was very helpful, courteous, and accommodating. The bad: Housekeeping staff, condition of rooms, lack of attention to cleanliness and minor details.  We stayed 3 nights overall and the housekeeping service rating was 2 out of 5 from my perspective.  Coffee was not refilled each day, charged for overpriced water bottles we didn't use, the adequate number of towels and toiletries were not provided (had to ask for them), the room was not made after calling housekeeping 3 times in a single day, the refrigerator/mini bar was not clean (sticky residue maybe from the previous guest).  Room condition: Floor boards were peeling and fell off in one area of the room.  Housekeeping should have noticed and called maintenance to get it fixed. The bathroom door did not slide unless a lot of force was applied. At the price point for this hotel, those are the basic things you expect to just work. Front desk staff operates like robots.  My observation and interaction with  3-4 of them did not impress. I felt like I was a burden to them if I asked anything. And when we complained about the above-mentioned items to two different people the response was plain and simple... We're sorry. That's it?... That statement needs to be followed up by...We're sorry and we're going to make it right for you by x,y,z.  We're going to take your feedback and make sure we improve. None of that happened. That's the difference between a good experience and a great experience.  Unfortunately, Lowes Miami you fell short.",Good but not great.

It is certainly one of the most attractive hotels along this famous beach. Very handy if you want to watch the sunrise or sunset (see photo). Room on a high floor was spacious and immaculately clean. View was lovely, a partial view of the beach (see photo), but a highlight was a small balcony where you could gaze at the flocks of pelicans flying by (see photo). 
Dislikes? Very few. The coffee bar in the lobby of the hotel could be improved, bland coffee and slow service. The hotel could really profit by having a much better coffee bar as all the nearby Starbucks had massive queues all the time especially in the mornings.

Loews have their own beach area, towels and chairs are free, you only pay for umbrellas if needed. Beach staff are very helpful. There is also a large pool at the hotel. Generally it was exceptionally busy, and unfortunately there was the selfish habit of people leaving private items on sun loungers so they could keep them all day though they frequently left the area, people will be people. Would be good if the hotel had a policy to cut down on this type of selfish behaviour.

In these large hotel chains the lifts (elevators) can often be slow or too few for the large occupancy, but this was not the case here.

Expect to spend a lot of money at the resort. $150 on breakfast every morning for a family of (4). Lunch another $150-$200. Even the drinks were $20-$30 by the pool and not very good.  They charge you for an umbrella on the beach (these should be complimentary) and $300+ if you want a 2 person lounge bed on the beach. 

The staff while mostly helpful, seemed a little clueless if you asked about anything beyond what their job was. Errors at check in and had to move rooms twice on our first day. 

Another thing that bugged me was the chair situation at the pool. If you aren’t down there by 8am you are not getting a chair by the pool. This happened to us twice during our stay when we slept in a little. I think for the size of the hotel there should be more pools as the pool area was beyond crowded the entire week we were there. 

Hotel is fine - rooms were Ok. Able to walk to many restaurants and shops in the area. Not worth what we paid though per night IMO.

-the bill was full of charges the front desk could not explain. They told me  I had to call Monday to talk to the accounting department
-they added a $7.95 charge per day for internet we did not use. They did remove that when I complained.
-do not order anything without checking the price. I got charged $10 for a soda and $32 for a frozen drink (compared to $20 on the menu)
-the electrics were awful. The plugs kept falling out of the wall, so the light would randomly shut off and charging phones was difficult.
-the bedding was not put on the bed properly, and we had to remove the sheets to fix it.
- the website makes it sound like the kids club is included. It is actually more like a drop off daycare, and there is an extra charge.

I was happy to splurge for a nice vacation. I now wish I had stayed at the Hampton Inn.",Charges leave a bad taste

We had stayed a few years ago and thought it was superb, so when we had the opportunity to  visit again, as an anniversary getaway we seized the opportunity with both hands!

This hotel is a huge disappointment now.

The rooms are tired and the cleanliness poor. We were greeted by a bathroom populated by long black hairs and fixtures and fittings that were either broken, or falling apart.

Perfect for spring break getaway with teens. 

POOL
Had sunblock and aloe available. Plenty of water stations. There were plenty of kids in the pool throwing balls and on floats/noodles. You can also buy balls at the pool shop. Pool was kept super clean and food at Nautilus was great. Rec room was also good for playing video games per my son. 

I did notice chairs by pool did need to be reserved early in order to get. By 8am they were mostly taken. 

ROOM
We were given a lovely upgrade -1657 Ocean Front. We had originally booked ocean view double on a high floor but to our surprised it was ocean front. 
We did not get to check in early as requested which wasn’t too fun. Room was ready after 4. The beds are super comfortable and linens clean and soft. Service was fast when asking for fridge/microwave to be brought up. Housekeeping was always working and friendly. 
*at check-in, we weren’t told about any of the services offered or restaurants on site. I am still not sure what time the pool closes. 

Quick walk to Starbucks on the cement path and Ocean Drive. However-highly recommend Miami Joe in the hotel. Amazing pastries and the pop tart was so good! Preston’s was also great for breakfast and pastries/muffins seems to be the same as Miami Joes. Buffet for kids was $19 each. 

BEACH
as mentioned chairs are not close to water but plenty of them and the beach is maintained and clean. However we experienced tons of seaweed. We took advantage of the free banana boat ride and boogie boards. Waves were small but water is clear minus seaweed. 

Overall this hotel felt like a resort and was super happy it was kid friendly. Can’t wait to return.",Great Family- Friendly hotel with a resort feel

I had business meetings in Miami Beach and wanted to stay in the heart of the action. I have a business and don't always like to be spendy to stay at top of the line places when doing deals, which may not yield results. I knew I'd be dropping some coin at Joe's Stone Crab (within walking distance) so I wanted a budget hotel. There were a few about a mile away but I wanted one close enough to walk to the restaurants and beach.

First off ... this is not a luxury hotel. It's a basic hotel. But it's cleaner and the rooms are bigger than a lot of the Art Deco dumps which look great on the outside but are grimy on the inside. If money was no object, let's be honest, I'm not staying here. But on a budget, this is better than what you'll find at 90% of other SOBE hotels.

The staff is great here. Both the manager and the owner are fantastic. I was upgraded upon arrival to a full apartment from a studio suite. The manager gave me both keys to check out each room before committing to one, which I actually loved! I travel a lot and often 'upgrades' sometimes don't always mean a better room.

The studio suite I booked, I expected to be tiny and closet-sized as it was the lowest category of room. It was  actually 350 sq feet and bigger than my room at the airport Marriott I stayed in the night before! The apartment was ridiculously big. 750 square feet and perfect to walk around in.

The rooms had bad views and I had to keep the drapes closed the whole time, or neighbors could stare in ... but who cares because the beach was literally across the street! Trust me ... if you are in Miami, you want to stay in this area. At night, you can walk up and down the strip to many bars and restaurants and it always feels safe. Other parts of Miami ... good luck to you.

The hotel has valet parking. (Which is rare in SOBE) It's $35, which is about on par. I paid $30 for a spothero at the Target garage, which was a short walk (10 min.) or 5-6 blocks. I did so because the hotel resets the clock at 11 a.m. and I got a few extra hours of beach time by using spothero. A lot of hotels had no valet parking, so it's nice if you are in a rush.

The top floor pool was completely closed during my stay, which is a bummer. However, when open, this will be a huge perk to guests. Although the pool is small the views of the ocean are great ... and there would be a lot of space to relax. I can't wait to return when the pool is open. Overall, I was very surprised and pleased with my stay here and would stay again. Budget hotels can be scary in Miami. This one is a gem.",Surprise gem in the heart of it all!

I simply can't reconcile those reviews with our unfortunate experience. It is painfully obvious that ownership has set up their staff to fail, leaving them with no resources, inadequate amenities, and not nearly enough staff.

We booked an Ocean View Suite with 1 bedroom and kitchen and looked forward to our winter getaway vacation. Upon checking in, however, our hearts instantly dropped. 

The ""cleaning"" standards for housekeeping are disturbingly low. The kitchen, dishes, utensils, bathroom, floors, and seating furniture were all uncleaned. No sweeping, no vacuuming, certainly no scouring...not even light wiping with a damp rag. If you want more details, you can view photos or read extended comments further below.

There were also lots of unkempt things about the room's functionality (e.g. no hangers in the closets, several light bulbs burned out, a single dead cockroach on the floor of the closet, top sheets with cigarette burns used for fitted sheets, key cards needed to be reprogrammed five times the first night alone, etc.) In all, it painted a rather clear picture that no one was really paying any level of attention to details and had never considered the guest experience as a whole.

There was a single employee on staff from 5pm until the next morning. She was nice, but spoke only limited english. She really tried to help, but was obviously overwhelmed, under-supplied, under-trained, unsupported and simply unable to provide even basic customer service. I honestly felt sorry for her. The other dissatisfied guests (and there were a lot of them!) were far less patient or understanding of her constraints.

In short, The Frtiz Hotel was just an all-around disappointment and it almost ruined our trip to South Beach. The only reason I'm giving two stars is that the manager was genuinely concerned for our negative experience and sympathetic to our situation. He helped us find a hotel more to our liking, allowed us out of the rest of our reservation, and was extremely apologetic for the divergent standards in cleanliness. I do wish him well and hope that ownership supplies him with adequate staff and resources to make the hotel more successful in the future.

EXTENDED DETAILS:

The bathroom tub had hair stuck on the wall and half-used soap and shampoo left on the tile. Only one washcloth and two towels were provided; the towels were wet but had been refolded and hung to imply ""unused,"" which they were not. Both the sink and tub drains were clogged with debris and there was only 1/2 roll of toilet paper to be found.

The kitchen was an utter disgrace. Everything was grimy and unwashed: cabinets, coffeemaker, utensils, dishes, fridge handle, you name it. No dish soap, no dish rag (we had to use our only washcloth) no paper towels, no cleaning supplies at all. Only odds and ends for dishes and cutlery: a single spoon, two salad forks, two different sized bowls, mismatched pots and lids, etc. Certainly not even close to a basically functional kitchen. Coffee grounds (no filter) were left in the coffee maker. Huge smears of chocolate (we hope) on a ""clean"" coffee cup in the cupboard...you get the idea.

When we asked the desk worker for clean (and dry) towels she said there were none and we'd have to wait until tomorrow. When I asked for some coat hangers, she came back with a mixture of random ones she had hastily grabbed from down in the restaurant. When we asked for a vacuum to clean our floors, she said the hotel didn't have one. And upon our return from the store (to buy cleaning supplies), our key cards stopped working and I stood waiting at the empty lobby desk for 45 minutes (along with four other guests) until she returned from wherever she was.

Living room chairs were covered in stains and felt grimy and/or sticky. Floor was unswept and so walking with bare feet picked up grit and debris with each step. We spent the first night of our vacation scrubbing cabinets, cleaning sinks and dishes, scouring the disgusting tub, replacing lightbulbs, and searching the hotel's linen closets for a new set of unstained sheets.

There's really So much more, but I think I've painted an adequate picture already demonstrating The Fritz Hotel simply isn't ready to adequately serve its guests.",Room was truly disgusting. Woefully understaffed and under-maintained.

It is located at the southern end of South Beach and is close to everything that South Beach offers.  Upon arrival we had been allocated a room on the ground floor directly adjacent to the al fresco bar/restaurant.  The noise from the loud music was not tolerable.  Thankfully, we were offered an alternative room on the 3rd floor, not close to the bar!  Thanks to the proprietor for arranging this quickly and courteously.  In fact, service from the hotel staff in general was very good.
Although our room was spacious and clean, and had powerful a/c, the decor felt a little tired.  The same comments apply to the public areas including the (small) roof-top pool.  The hotel offers complimentary beach towels but not beach chairs or parasols, which have been available at other South Beach hotels we have stayed at.  The beach itself is literally just over the road (which is now a one-way street with vastly restricted traffic flow), so highly convenient.
Overall we had a good stay in South Beach ad the Fritz was a decent option for accommodation.","Good location, great service"

Boardwalk. Street was closed for CoVid restrictions and restaurants had outdoor seating under canopies/umbrellas.

In addition this restaurant/ hotel had fans to keep air circulating.  

Shrimp tacos - full of shrimp and seasoning short on rice and bean sides. I was okay with more shrimp and less sides.   
Chicken quesadillas were very
Good.  Cuban sandwich not pressed enough. Cheese wasn’t even melted.
Pork dish had plenty of meat.

WaIt for food after ordering was too long.  More than 20 minutes.  Also, server forgot about my son’s order and getting his food after we had all been served took another 15-18 minutes.

The clarity was amazing. Our balcony view of the pool and ocean made our daily views spectacular. Beach access steps away from the pool. Pool area was fantastic and the addition of the poolside bar(currently under construction) will be quite convenient, although expect the drink prices to be quite high as they add gratuity and resort fees to every drink purchased. Breakfast available daily but was pricey as well. Resort fees cover pool/beach towels, ice buckets, and 2 beach chairs and umbrella. Don’t let the smaller sized building fool you into thinking it isn’t a nice place. It allows more personalized service! Plus it is part of the Wyndham hotel group so you add points with each stay.

First of all: I travel extensively & have stayed at hotels all across the world. I have stayed at several of Miami’s most famous hotels: The Setai, the Ritz-Carlton, the Fontainebleau, Loews. I had never stayed in a 3 stars hotels before & this hotel is better than some of the 4 stars hotels I have patronized.

My boyfriend chose it & it’s perfectly located near our friends who live a few blocks south on Collins Avenue. 
It is extremely easy to get to South Beach, Coral Gables & Little Havana, places where we like to eat. It has also an easy access Key Biscayne where I also regularly visit friends.

The Wyndham MB Trademark is so much better than we expected!
The staff is amazing: 
ALOIS took over 30 minutes to answer my call & address all my questions before we decided to finalize our booking. 
Alois, JAVIER & ADRIANA are all at the front desk & they go above & beyond to be helpful, are extremely accommodating, pleasant, nice & professional. 
OSCAR & ACHILLES at the restaurant are also amazing. Oscar just brings a smile on your face anytime you see him because he is so sweet, friendly & always smiling & trues his best to make you feel like you are home.

Based on other reviews it seems like some of the rooms need to be updated. I cannot speak about those rooms. 
We stayed in an updated room and everything was great: the bathroom & the bedroom are big.  The only issue for us: there was not enough closet space & no drawers. We were staying for a long time and needed more storage place but guests who come for a weekend or a few days will be absolutely fine.

The hotel is located right on the beach.
The beach access is easy. Between the hotel and the beach there is a beautiful pool area that is gorgeous & well maintained with daily morning clean up. The pool is also much larger than expected.
 I don’t think the hotel’s online pictures showcase how great the hotel is.

Working on the beach you have: Leo & Santiago who are also extremely accommodating & nice.

For the price, this is definitely a fantastic deal! 
I don’t have a reason to stay in a hotel in Miami unless I am there with friends celebrating a bachelorette party, a special birthday, a girls’ weekend and so forth. 
But I know that this is a place I want to come back to very soon…. Mainly for the wonderful staff but also because of the beautiful place & the small scale of the hotel. I do not like large 
hotels. This is a small boutique hotel that I 
think Wyndham will keep on improving & hopefully get all the stars it deserves. 

We were there while they were actually redoing the fifth floor restaurant and we could only enjoy it for a few days but they did a fantastic job. The view is  unbelievable and once again the restaurant staff is just beyond kind, accommodating and fun and it does make a difference when you are on vacation.
The hotel is conveniently located near a lot of very good restaurants such as one of my favorite Miami restaurant, the Peruvian gem Locura  Marina. 
The hotel is also very accessible by public transportation, is on the route of the free Miami trolley (we took it once & it was great) and it also offers a parking right across the street for a dayly $20 fee. 

I wish I could have stayed there a full month. I know I will be visiting them soon enough & I even joined the Wyndham hotel Rewards Loyalty program because I know I will be a regular guest to this property.",A wonderful stay!

My honey and I arrived to the hotel, checked in with minimal issues and in awe of the beautiful lobby layout. We were given a room right near the front desk and proceeded to check out our room. Immediately went to the bathroom where there was STILL PEE RESIDUE on the toilet along with a filthy shower, I was ready to leave. 

To avoid escalating, I left the problem to my honey and we were ""upgraded"" to a new room. Upgrade is was not. The room was bigger, but cleaner it was not. The bathroom walls and counter were filthy, tub more clean but notable hair in the sink. 

I completed my usual shake down of the room using my lysol along the way noting the filthy sheets. I really tried to be nice but after waking up to a HUGE ROACH ON THE FLOOR I realized a review was needed. We then requested for house keeping to mop and sweep. 

Housing keeping entered the room laughing and without her mask pulled up. I am not the smartest cookie but I do not understand why staff wear mask on there face to not actually have it over their mouth and nose. Makes ZERO sense. Also, they should respect people space and make sure to wear a mask when entering the room. Its rude.

Ultimately, staff was not bad and the pool and beach access was the best part of the hotel.  Being able to leave in out with parking was also great to have. It is clear no one is in charge, seems as if the hotel is ran by a bunch of children. Housekeeping needs to be fired and rehired. This hotel has potential but needs to pick it up before its too late.",I really wanted to like it!

After my first stay, I called the hotel to speak directly with the manager of the hotel to make the second one and a third one. My goal was to get the travel agency out of the way and stay at a more affordable price, and prevent the hotel from paying commission to the agency. Even though I left a note to manager Erika 5-6 times, the manager did not respond to me. When I didn't get a response, I made my reservation through booking.com.

A few days before my departure day, I informed the long hair male receptionist that I wanted a late check-out. He said that if there is availability on the day of my departure, I can do a late check-out which is reasonable. Then, two days before my check-out, I spoke to the receptionist Adriana and she said she approves of my late check-out. They made me suffer on the day of my check-out. The first person I spoke to at the reception, who told me that I could check out late if there was availability, retorted me by saying ""how can she give approval without my knowledge?"" and kept an unprofessional conversation with me in return for my solution-oriented conversations. Acted needlessly defensive as I was blaming him. He told me that even if I spoke to the manager the outcome would not change.

After that, I said that I wanted to meet with manager Erika, but despite my endless attempts, Erika did not respond to me. If I tried to reach the American president as much as I tried to reach Erika, I would have succeeded.

Erika, managing a hotel isn't just about coming in at the end of the day and getting the collection. I left you messages many times over the period of time and you didn't get back to me. As a customer who has stayed at your hotel three times before, I will not return to your hotel again because you are not a manager who does her job correctly and the low ratings of your hotel explains why. Miami Beach is a very competitive area, you are literally surrounded on your left and right with two hotels. You must've enormous guts not to respond your customer or you hate your boss. I don't know.

As for the hotel, the location of the hotel is very nice.

The rooms are not spacious and a bit suffocating as they are surrounded by tall buıldings on the sides. Not enough sunlight.

Housekeeping comes every three days.

Staff is meeeh. They don't really make you feel like there is an authority above them. They act like they are the owners and not responsible to report to their supervisor.

Like I said, I had ignore all these negative aspects before for the location but I won't be going back to a place where I am not welcomed.

Especially during these hard times you have to treat your customers as golden!",Staff doesn't care about you

Art deco style building, inside is a mixture on modern and historic. Rooms are spacious and comfy. The structure itself is not gigantic, so you don't get to cross many people. It is located on Collins Avenue, just behind the chaos and therefore even on the busy weekend nights you are not so bothered by the noise. There is no free parking, but the hotel offers a valet parking service, which in Miami beach is alwasys a plus.

A week prior I cancelled it and booked The Marlin given the reviews and ranking.   We've stayed at Loews, The Betsy and Ritz Carlton previously.   Regretted that decision and surprised this property it ranks as high as it does.

Pros
- beautifulyl designed lobby.   our room (corner suite) was lovely, in great condition and well appointed.  Very clean
- wifi was really good overall 
- i noticed mostly families - which is great as its quiet in the evening and night, but starting fairly early in the morning, we heard alot of doors and kids in the hall.  Its not the best for sound proofing

Cons
- the service is underwhelming at best.   a very low energy vibe - lacking hospitality and engagement.   Especially the two ladies overseeing the breakfast service (perhaps less engaged on a personal cell phone will on the job might help - especially when there are empty tables that need to be cleared).  The service we experienced at breakfast didn't encourage us to have dinner at the restaurant - we went elsewhere.
- breakfast offering was b.a.s.i.c.   We came down at 9:30 and barely anything left - they replenished very slowly (a reflection of the lack of attentiveness by the staff).
- when we checked in, we were explained the resort fee - which we were told included beach chairs, breakfast and use of the bathrobes !?! 
- there is a scent that is pumped throughout the lobby, hall and rooms.   I found it quite strong and unpleasant.    it certainly wasn't subtle.
- the lobby reception staff just sit there - not once did i see them get up and assist guests.    when we checked out, there was no one waiting behind me, and the young fella watched my husband get all our bags out and down the front stairs, and after we settled our room and i turned to leave, he sat there and asked ""do you want some help?"" ... after we got everything out - how helpful.    Good hospitality would've been to get up and take initiative to help with our bags without asking us.",Our experience didn't live up to its ranking

My son was blown away by the Murphy bed but more importantly, the 2-room suite was clean, roomy, and quiet.  There was refrigerator space for some essentials, comfortable bedding and good drawer and hanging space.  We were in the main building-- there's a small but beautiful roof deck that was easy to access, and we spent lots of time in the pool in the building next door.  The pool was quiet, mostly adults lounging in the sun, but it was perfect for my son, who was just learning to swim.  The 3-4 foot depth was ideal for a kid, and there were some nice shady areas to relax.  The location was great-- 2 blocks from the pool, quick walk to shops on Lincoln Road, a few kid-friendly restaurants (take out from Taco Taco, take out or eat in at Time Out Miami market).  Downsides-- limited parking nearby, we did valet parking each day for a fee, lighting in the room was a little dim.","Great location, beautiful pool"

He acknowledged my husband’s birthday and even sent a bottle of champagne and birthday card to our room on his actual special day!  The ambience of this hotel is magnificent and aroma that radiates throughout the facility is calming and refreshing.  Our room was a Deluxe King in the Sunrise building with a relaxing pool on the roof.  They offer free wine between 6-7pm daily along with water, coffee throughout the day in the lobby. Much to our surprise we did get 15% off at the Americana café just displaying our room card. 

What a lovely boutique hotel right in the center of everything.  A giant plus is they offer free beach chairs and beach towels and you only have to pay for the beach umbrella if you desire one.

The hotel's entrance is on a side street - which is a much more zen welcome than arriving at a hotel on the bustling main drag of Collins Avenue.  

I was met by the two receptionists who quickly checked me in and I was escorted to my room by a lovely bellman.  The king size room was very spacious, and sun drenched, and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept in, in quite some time.  The  neutral tones of the decor kept with the very zen vibe I was hoping for.

What a treat to have an old record player, in the room, where I listened to Marvin Gay while getting dressed for a delicious cocktail downstairs at Cafe Americano.

Our room was very clean and well decorated, however there is a serious lack of storage for 3 people, in the bedroom (no closed cupboard just 5 hangers and a single bedside table for 2 beds) and in the bathroom (no cupboard just the sink to put our things and just a hook for a towel), well-stocked mini bar, however, it was very difficult to get bottles of water (when we arrived from a bike ride we were thirsty and asked to buy a bottle water at the reception unfortunately this was not possible)... The Americano café in which you can have lunch and which is attached to the hotel is very good but a bit expensive ($80 USD for 3 people for small lunches) and some servers are not really patient with people who do not speak English or Spanish well, no possibility of eating just an omelet you will have to take the whole dish unfortunately ....

From the moment I checked in early with Gloria and Melinda until Heidi arranged a late check out everyone made me feel like family. This is a lovely new hotel that has a lot of charm and a personal touch. My ""sunrise luxury"" room was well appointed, very comfortable and had a nice view of Collins ave at 18st.  The rooftop pool is an incredible place to relax if you prefer to take a day off from the beach (beach lounge chairs are included).  Natalia serves wine at the rooftop pool bar from 6:00-7:00 and she is amazing to talk to!  My only suggestion for improvement is to include serving frozen cocktails (margaritas, pina coladas) and have a food option available at the pool during the afternoon. In my opinion this is the best hotel in South Beach.  Uma House will be my new ""go to"" for vacations when I return!

I am grateful to Domenica, Freddy, Gloria, Guido, Heidi, Julian, Kristian, Maria, Melinda and Natalia for making this such a wonderful Birthday/Christmas celebration!

All the best!

I think this was our 4th stay and disappointingly the standards  have definitely dropped. Firstly, they have removed the reception desk and getting service proved challenging. Nothing flows as it used to - check in and check out was painful! 
The cleaning service was really poor. We came back to our room around 4pm and our rooms had not been serviced. When we eventually got hold of someone in reception (not possible to ring down, so you physically have to go down and find someone these days!) they were very surprised that our room hadn’t been done. Not only was our room not done but our friends room was also not done. Strange, really given that there were three cleaning staff loitering in the corridor having a chat!!! it took us four separate visits to get everything we needed as they didn’t replace the beach towels, bath towels, toilet roll, and  coffee. The beach chairs in our friends room were really poor quality/broken and not the usual Tommy Bahama chairs that they usually provide. We did ask to get them changed, but they told us they could not do this. There was also confusion at breakfast; we had breakfast included, and when we came to settle a bill for the additional coffees the waitress was a little stroppy with us because we didn’t have a voucher. Apparently the voucher should’ve been given a check in, but since check in is no longer efficient, we were not given the vouchers! Beach towels were also not replaced daily. Used to be able to pick them up from a basket next to the beach chairs and this was a much better system. The carpet in the lift is in desperate need of being changed. The corridor lighting is so depressing and it makes the whole place feel dirty and grungy. All in all the changes they have made definitely make the experience disappointing. For the price they now charge I think there are much better places to stay. The location is great as is breakfast, and it’s nice to have the rooftop pool, but everything else let’s it down",Disappointing 4th stay

I got there early due to my flight, and although I knew my room wouldn't be ready, I didn't expect luggage to just be left sitting in the lobby area where anyone could get at it.   While I left for a bit to go grab a bite to eat, I had to dig through my luggage before I left to grab my valuables.   I would hope the hotel would at least consider a locked closet somewhere to store luggage for guests.

I do recommend the Key Lime French toast for brunch.   It was utterly amazing!",Nice Boutique hotel

All great.

It's expensive staying anywhere decent in South Miami, but here you are paying for a great boutique hotel with breakfast included. Other reviews may have mentioned the coffee, which is Julius Meinl. But it helps that it's served with the help of a pro coffee machine run by an expert. This was the best coffee on an entire vacation in Florida. If I was out for a walk on South Beach, I'd seriously stop just for that. 

The only downside to this place is that some of the breakfast items were cooked early in the morning, a common practice, but the restaurant does not seem to have a very good warmer. However the coffee and excellent home fries recipe made up for it. 

Noise can be an issue in this very busy part of Miami, but this is a pretty good spot for that, it just has regular city traffic, there are no booming clubs super close. The doors to the rooms are average, so if anyone else on your floor arrives back at the hotel at a late hour, talking up a storm...well..you may hear that. But that can happen pretty much anywhere I suppose.

The rooftop pool may be a bit chilly for people from the warmer states, but for us, it was perfect, we had the entire roof to ourselves, with local beer that is just an elevator ride away. Pretty great, we may well be back.","Great Location, Great Staff"

Its an unfortunate misstep. 

By staffing onsite management with inexperienced persons they end up without a professionally run hotel. 

Morning manager: Victoria, is still learning their trade.  That learning curve has not gone beyond the opening chapters of the ""Hospitality 101"" text book.  

That approach was unsettling. Attempts at client outreach only mask a ""corporate"" rather than human persona, and at their own admission, a desire to move to more lucrative opportunities.  At a small boutique hotel that wishes to pride itself on its ""family"" like vibe, that is unnerving, and a staffing mistake.

Afternoon desk personal is committed to their art making. That seems a nice gesture by someone who brought them on board...but, really?!?

Ultimately, the missteps and poor oversight required us to contact  POLICE at 2 AM due to all common area music being left on ""party""beat mode.  The police were not able to reach the management, and could not access the volume controls. Music continued till morning. For us, in Room 3, directly above the speakers,  it was a lost night of sleep, prior to a very important day business day for us. This resulted in a loss of income for us.

Note: we were compensated by removing the $30 resort fee. (lol) 
Plus they allowed us to check out early without penalty.  Gee thanks. NOTE: this is a clause all guests should be very careful with)   

Satisfactory accountability on their part was stated, but actions demonstrated it was lip service only.  That is on Victoria's shoulders. We are not sure its even worth taking this to ownership.  We feel certain it will happen again, and let someone else fight that battle.

In the end, onsite management's inexperience overshadowed any pluses. ( We left five days earlier than we had planned.)  It was a real shame.

The Local House states a desire to foster a loyal clientele. It did not accomplish this goal with us.

Good luck in their future efforts. We will not return.","Inexperienced Management, Absent Owner"

The beach is super close, just across the street and they provide you with beach chairs and a beach umbrella in your room (a great detail). Our room was large with a nice balcony to sit outside and people watch. It was very clean and had all the amenities we needed. The breakfast at the restaurant was outstanding and though we didn’t have any other meals there, the menu had some amazing entrees on it. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel. The location is fantastic (lots of restaurants and shops within a block or so), it was clean and comfortable. If we ever return to Miami Beach, we will most definitely stay there again.

I had an awful experience at this hotel and I want to invite you to read this review in order for you to make an informed decision on where to stay. 

I booked because they were in Miami Beach, nice location and nice facilities, BUT the service was terrible, they want to charge you extra fees and extra everything and it appears to be that their only purpose is not serving, but charging the guests for everything and anything.   Having been in more than 33 countries and having booked dozens of hotels in my life, this is the first time I encounter such a bad and vicious service. Where in the world they charge to use the facilities? I thought that came with the price of the stay/night. But this place want's to charge you for using the facilities and the fee is not optional, you pay or you pay. Terrible!! The fee is like the price of one night, which is very expensive and the facilities are not that great, this is not the Mandarin Oriental my friends.

This hotel has an extra fee that is not advertised. They want to charge you for everything and anything. They also don't have a 24/7 reception, which is a problem, since my plane arrived at 3am. BEWARE! If you arrive at a time that their reception is not open, you cannot enter the hotel!! 

They only start working at 7am, and they told me the room might get available at 12pm. What??? What was I suppose to do from 3am to 12pm? Their answer? ThEY DON'T CARE. Simply terrible service from this hotel. I will never book it again in Miami beach. I called and they told me they might send someone to recieve me, but that the room will be at 12pm. What? Terrible. Then they said it was impossible to open the door for me at my arrival, and that I had to wait in the airport until 12pm. HORRIBLE! I don't know why is this hotel percieved or on the top list of browsers. Perhaps they are paying very hard to be there, but what a mess of a hotel!! They are not what they are advertise!! BEWARE!!! 

They also don't seem to care about you, the perception I recieved was that they only want to charge the money for the room plus every possible fee they make up! They simply don't know or care about costumer service. After recieving an email that their reception was not 24 hours, I asked for a refund, and they replied it was impossible. 

LOL!! I have been to more than 33 countries, impossible? NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU TRULY CARE ABOUT GIVING GOOD SERVICE. Look, everything is possible if you want to.  Especially if you truly care about your image and want to offer the costumer a good experience. They are simply a bad hotel, with very dark, vicious and ugly fees, they also had bad intentions with the guests, their only aim is to gain and gain money at your expense at whatever cost, no matter if it damages the hotels reputation. TERRIBLE!!! DON'T STAY HERE!!!!!!! IS NOT WHAT'S ADVERTISED!!!!!!","TERRIBLE!! BEWARE!!! HIDDEN FEES, BAD SERVICE AND NON 24 HOURS RECEPTION. THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT GIVING GOOD SERVICE.."

It's in an excellent position with the road outside pedestrian only so relatively quiet for central South Beach!
The breakfast was fine  - eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast, or other choices and tea or coffee.

However, we booked  a classic room, and it had a few issues.
The room looked cool with exposed brickwork and wooden blinds.
But the bathroom had a sliding door right opposite the end of the bed; the door  was not even long enough to completely cover the door gap so no privacy whatsoever. The bathroom had nowhere to put anything. Only 2 large towels were provided, and there's no extractor fan in the bathroom.
The fixed shower door is 6"" too short so water just cascades onto the floor.
The bed was very small, I think it was smaller than a standard double, and the pillows were very lumpy. Nowhere to put your suitcase
There is no sound proofing so you can hear the people in the next room even talking.
We did ask if we could move on the first night but were told there was nothing else available except a smaller room with 2 beds.

We had the suite on the second floor, their ""best room"" as the person at check in told me. I have stayed at ""boutique"" hotels before in South Beach, and was not sure what to expect. I have seen some cruddy rooms. However, this room was VERY nice and roomy. Living room with pull put couch, a seprate bedroom, and washroom that's accessible from both rooms. A small hallway when you enter. Nice big windows overlooking Ocean Drive and the beach.

The room is comfy, modern, and lots of room. Nice washroom. However, two small things would make this room much better.

There are no locks on the washroom doors, and there are doors on two sides -- from the living room and the bedroom. I am sure many people have been ""walked into"" while in the washroom. Even some small cheap eye and socket locks from a hardware store would work. 

Also, the bedroom should have a door to separate it from the rest of the suite. This would also be a fairly simple addition. There is not a lot of privacy if you are two couples, or even a family, in the suite.

Reception was very nice nice and helpful. The location is superb of course, right on Ocean Drive. Breakfast was slow service, but it was busy, and the food was good. A full hot breakfast was included for all 4 of us. There was a festival on the beach that blocked our access to the water, which kind of sucked. We had to walk up to 10th St (3 blocks) to get to the beach. Not the hotel's fault of course. The Irish Pub beside the hotel was very fun, although my memory there is a bit hazy for some reason.

Well, forget my initial doubts, I was in fact really impressed by the hotel and will come back with some enthusiasm. 

The location is excellent, in the art deco area of South Beach, directly on Ocean drive. This is one of the prettiest parts of Miami beach to walk around and one very well equiped in small hotels, restaurants, bars, etc. 

My room was beautifully decorated, with a tropical feel, dark woods, and colourful highlights due to contemporary colourful reinterpretations of classic portraits. Bed was very comfortable, and whilst I usually prefer rooms with bathtubs, the showerroom was very nice with dark woods and golden mosaic highlights and a very good shower. Toiletries were good quality and generously stocked and towels were fluffy and nice.  There is an empty mini fridge which was great as I was there during very rough weather and this allowed me to stock up on food till tropical storm Nicole moved away (the restaurant was closed for lunch and dinner for a couple of days as a result of the weather). 

Like many (most?) Miami beach hotels, the Cavalier charges an annoying resort fee (around $25/day I think), I hate those, but at least in this case, you know what you are paying for: you get a simple but nice breakfast every morning: a choice of one dish (fried or scrambled eggs with one meat, scrambled eggs with vegetables, pancakes, or yoghurt and fruit, alongside coffee or tea). You get access to beach chairs at a nearby cabana on the beach (Esteban's about 5 minutes' walk - basically the hotel is at the corner of 13th and the beach is off 15th). You get the towels from the hotel itself. Umbrellas cost extra if you want them. You also get decent internet and coffee and tea in the lobby all day. 

Personnel was very nice, especially the young man who checked me in and again checked me out a couple of days later (didn't get his name but he was nice, helpful, and friendly). 

The hotel is small. ground floor + 2 levels up, the building itself is very pretty and well renovated, the lobby is nice and pleasant and when the weather is good, the restaurant also has tables outside on ocean drive. 

The bottom line: this is a real boutique hotel, not one of those 200 room places which call themselves boutique just to claim to be edgy. It is small, friendly, individual and has personality and a decor that makes a statement. It has the limitations of a small and relatively old hotel (so no swimming pool, no balconies, etc unlike the big modern buildings you find a bit further up the beach) but also the charm and friendliness that those big hotels often lack and it was beautiful, comfortable, and very well located. The free breakfast is a big bonus and I appreciated the empty mini fridge too. I'll surely be back!",A great South Beach boutique hotel

Excellent location on ocean drive.  Staff was very polite and housekeeping superb.  Very relaxing stay.  Only reason I did not rate the Cavalier perfect was because of the $28 per night resort fee.  That fee is not uncommon in south beach and wouldn’t be an issue except that it wasn’t disclosed when I booked and paid for my stay.  I booked the stay on Sam’s club travel so not really sure which to blame for the omission.

Very reasonably priced for the area and our price included the Resort Tax which gave us beach towels and sun loungers on the beach each day. The sun loungers have the option to add a parasol for $20 per day if you wish, but as we were there in October and the weather was 28°c we were okay with a parasol.
The hotel is 1930s in style and this must be taken into consideration, if you are expecting a modern 5* hotel, you will be disappointed, this hotel offers a 5* service and is very clean with spacious rooms. We would have loved a sea view room but these are limited, if we had paid more I'm sure a sea view would have been no issue. Breakfast was included in our price and although limited it was perfectly adequate for the price we paid. I enjoyed pancakes and adding bacon was not an issue. The breakfast team are friendly and attentive.
Eddie on the front desk is a star, such a polite and friendly young man. He told us about the many original features of the hotel and that the lift is original and of importance to the city of Miami.....he clearly enjoys his job and is proud of the building he works in.
All in all, we were impressed as we like small quirky hotels and try to avoid big corporate hotels, we will definitely be back.
I almost forgot, happy hour 5-7pm where reduced priced drinks and food is available, we had the drinks but not the food, however, we saw other tables getting food and it was a decent portion for the price.
It's also nextdoor but one from The Carlisle which was used in The Birdcage. Lovely area, lovely people, lovely hotel.","Good value for money, great location, art deco charm.... perfect for us."

I walked in upon the suggestion of someone to book a 1 week stay from 10/4-11, 2022. It looked great upon entering, I thought this should be a nice experience. It turned out to be anything but.  I came back from being out after a few hours on 10/8 to find my room door open. I was scared to enter and called the front desk right away. Eddie who was at the desk came up and said he saw it opened 1 hour before I arrived and said guests sometimes leave their doors open and he thought that was the case. I double check each time I leave the room that the door is tightly shut so I knew someone or  the staff were in my room, doing what I don't know. Eddie then asked if anything was stolen, and since nothing was taken don't worry about it. I was disgusted, insulted and I asked to change rooms.  Eddie said no rooms were available and when I asked to speak to a manager I was told Felipe the manager would be in on Monday. I slept with a chair behind the door, yes, I should've left the hotel altogether. I waited from 9-11:30 am on Monday 10/10 to speak with Felipe who I knew was in the hotel, but was told he's away and would be back later and told Eddie to change my room. It was not changed. I asked for Felipe's email and emailed him and Claudia Valdes, GM of the hotel right before noon,  no reply from either as of close to 9pm. Upon returning to my room around 8:30 pm, I discovered the main light in my room is on, I turned off all lights before prior to leaving  the room. I am so done. Add to all this I am bitten up by bed bugs in room 205 and a copy of my credit card and ID were photo copied by the front desk upon arrival, I spoke to another guest who said her information was not photocopied, I am pissed for accepting this b.s. treatment from this hotel and myself for staying.

The location was perfect, really, right on Ocean Drive in the heart of things. I dined at the restaurant the first night and just sat and people-watched. The churrasco was excellent and get one of their giant daiquiris - delish. The room was incredibly quiet for the area where I know they were blasting loud music until late. I turned in by 11 each night and didn't hear a thing - suspect they invested in triple-paned windows for sound dampening.

The only reason I'll ding them a star was the odd smell. It's an old old building so I'd expect a bit of mustiness - especially in the humid storm-ridden area - but the odor was more a mild sewage smell.

First of all, parking is terrible. The closest parking is the municipal/public parking which a lot of people use during day time for beach access which means it can get full on day time. If your car not inside that parking before noon, you will never get parking there till after 8pm when people starting to leave the beach. Your other option is the Herosa Hotel for valet but it is not close to your hotel which is difficult if you have luggages to push. The hotel itself is old and dated, you can see the lounge chairs in front lobby are sunked in. 
Our room was near the old charming elevator but very noisy, AC, tv, refrigerator are all not working, shower water pressure was not good either. The front desk said that they can not fix the AC, refrigerator but gave me a fan to help cool the room. Due to really hot weather in July, my husband and I woke up couple of times in middle of night to a sweat. I just think that they should not even give that room to any customer unless they fix it. Breakfast that included with the room rate was nothing to be excited about, coffee in lobby and water is just okay. I think next time I would go with a different hotel in South beach even though the front desks workers are so nice and accommodating.",Old charm but outdated

We were asked for ID and a credit card to swipe for a 200 dollar holding deposit which gave me reason for concern because I had already prepaid the booking of an upgraded room in full via a hotel booking web site. I was told this would be refunded on departure and this again was confirmed by her when we left. I had also used the parking valet service and the 37.50 fee was taken from my card without being asked if this was the way I wanted to pay for it. I had to say I wanted to pay the parking cash and the card transaction was cancelled. This may have been the way the hotel worked but the initial contact and them taking my details in this way put me on edge for the stay. We proceeded to the elevator to go to the room which was an old style with folding door. Nasrine helped and had a screwdriver to what I can only say was to manually adjust the elevator to make work correctly. We opted out of using it on safety reasons going up and down the stairs. The room was on the top floor and first impression was it looked good. The door was difficult to close and had to be slammed to get it shut. The room was clean and tidy with the essentials in the shower/wc room. Later in the evening a very loud noise started above the room sounding like the motor room or some kind of mechanical unit was directly above. I can say it sounded like an aircraft was continually taking off above the room until the early hours of the morning leaving us without any sleep. I did complain to the night receptionist but the problem was not resolved in any way. We had an evening meal at the hotel sitting outside. The food was good and the waiter applied a discount to the bill but a 20% tip was also included onto the bill receipt. The breakfast room was busy in the morning probably because it was raining outside and the food was good again but we felt very rushed and was asked to leave the table once we had eaten because other people were waiting to be seated. We did want to take a little longer on leaving but left shortly after breakfast as we had that uncomfortable feeling. We did mention the room situation to Nesrine at check out but it was brushed off by her and no apology was given and we have been reassured the holding deposit will be released but I’m of the opinion it should not have been taken or as a paying customer been put in this situation in the first place. Nice location for the hotel but will not be visiting it again in the future because of nose and personal safety concerns.",Beware room 312

The price I paid made me believe it was a high end hotel, but unfortunately it wasn’t.  

There was no way to control the room temperature and I froze or all night.  When I called reception, they brought in a mini heater, which only added a level of noise to the bedroom.  

The views from the room were horrible.  Just looking at another wall, 3 m away.  Again, not what you would expect from the price.  

I have yet to take a hot shower.  I left the shower on for up to half an hour, and I only managed to have a lukewarm experience.  

Breakfast is not in the hotel, but a block away.  You have to wait till 9 am for it to open and you get a voucher.  Breakfast was nothing to write home about.  

Room service, although it is offered, is not available.   I called reception and the gentleman did not seem to know how it all worked.   He asked me to remain on hold because he was going to find out.  I hang up after 10 minutes.

So, all in all, please I’m not going to return to.  Instead, I would just have a coffee in the reception and take some pictures next time.",Nice on the outside but poorly managed

The hotel has the right idea but misses the mark in ways that make it impossible to recommend. First, our room's bed squeaked so badly, that we couldn't move an inch without the squeak waking us all night. And the mattress was horribly sagging in the middle. It was quality to be expected in a cheap motel. Our room also had no towels, and we had to go to the front desk to get them ourselves. They were basically thread bare when we got them... that's when we realized our room had NO TOWEL HOOKS. Bathroom door is frosted glass that lets in light from the street all night and shows the silhouette of whoever is using the bathroom.... not so romantic. Just so so strange.. it's as if no one has ever stayed in this room and realized these things? We complained to a totally apathetic front desk employee in the morning who offered no apology or understanding, simply informed us they were fully booked. We said we would like the manager to take a look at our situation in that case, and the front desk person then told me to email the manager for faster service. Umm.. no? We are on vacation and I've already taken the time to inform the front desk about the issues. Ball's in your court from here, thanks! 

To the hotel's credit, they did give us two alternative room options later, although the first one they tried to show us was occupied (oops) when we walked in. Second one was right next to our original room, but had a much better bed. Walls are crazy thin. Room across from us blasted music, which we still preferred to the couple having an hours-long fight next door. I did hear a staff member knock on doors to ask for quiet, but the fighting continued later. You'll need a white noise app or ear plugs at the minimum. The old-fashioned elevator is cute but needs some maintenance and does not work properly 50% of the time. All this on top of being charged an extra $25 a day for breakfast at a different location and some towels and beach chairs, and there's just no way I can recommend this place.",Bizarre experience

Was excited to check it out after hearing about the recent makeover. First of all, you have to like staying at Vegas like hotel in Miami with 1500 rooms. 

Despite extremely friendly staff, I was extremely disappointed by the quality of the room and service for $500 a night! 

--Housekeeping didn't come despite my ask for it twice. 
--The door to my room didn't shut without having to push it closed.
--The toilet didn't flush well, took two pushes of the button.
--There were exposed outlets and an open electrical box. 
--I found a half drank wine bottle in the mini bar which wasn't replaced even after I called.
--And, rom service completely shuts down the hour before lunch, so you can't have food at noon. 

So many better options in Miami.","Friendly staff, poor facilities"

Staff were rude and pretentious and often seemed offended to be asked to assist with even a minor request. Our room was clean and decently sized (suite), but overpriced in comparison with similar hotels nearby. We did not see housekeeping for our three day stay and had to chase down fresh towels and go to a local CVS to buy shampoo and shower gel. The Scarpetta restaurant was overpriced with the food being at best bland. The wait staff were inattentive and we left early. We also dined at the Easter buffet which was massively overpriced, with poor quality food and a server who didn't bother to top up our 'bottomless' drinks despite an 18% gratuity being automatically applied to the check. As for the pools - we were rudely checked by the bouncer each time upon entry, the cabanas were $2700 per day and in a terrible location. The pools themselves were filthy with one member of our party taking time to clean out the debris before we allowed our children to swim. The pool area was overcrowded and it was extremely difficult to obtain a sun lounger. The pool restaurant was a further ripoff - $450 for sandwiches with the waiter telling our children that they could not order from the kids menu.

We were treated extremely well, and the recommendations the hotel concierge made for us for day and night entertainment were top par. We were fashionably late for many of the events outside of the hotel because we were enjoying ourselves too much at the pool and at the bar.

Price.  $30 for a not so good glass of Pino Grigio?  cmon.
Bagel/cream cheese, Oatmeal. 2 OJ.  $86 room service.  What?
No nearby grocery stores (so you can get your own OJ/Wine...).  No nearby restaurants.  Lincoln Road is best  $30 round trip in a taxi.

So great place -- no doubt.  Pricey and don't think you'll get WIFI good enough to do serious work.  Yes I know.. it's a holiday.. but sometimes you just have to get the laptop out.

With 2 cranky, sleepy children, we decided to leave and go to another hotel nearby.  Fontainebleau documented our “cancellation” on paper and assured us a full refund for our trouble.  Here’s the thing: THEY CHARGED US ANYWAY.  We called almost a dozen times and were told each time that their “accounting department” would call us back.  THEY NEVER DID.  They basically took our money for a room they never gave us and then GHOSTED US.  After months of unanswered calls, we filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau.  They just advised us that the hotel NEVER ANSWERED the complaint, despite multiple attempts.

PLEASE, PLEASE look at their rating on the Better Business Bureau Website for Southern Florida.  This hotel has a D- RATING for multiple unanswered complaints.  Look at their reviews for Labor Day Weekend 2022 and you’ll see DOZENS of complaints just like mine.  I’m sure it’s great assuming nothing goes wrong.  But if something does, they will clearly TAKE YOUR MONEY AND RUN.  If they need to rely on shady business practices like these, they have absolutely NO INTEGRITY as a business.  There are plenty of hotels in Miami.  AVOID THIS ONE LIKE THE PLAGUE.",Shady Business Practices with No Integrity - AVOID

A large, obnoxious group of people has descended on the joint over spring break, and have allowed their disorderly children and tweens to joyride the elevators, loiter in the halls, and generally undermine the sophistication and magic this iconic hotel once possessed.

On account of this large group, it takes 20 minutes for the elevators to arrive. And we’ve been having to sardine ourselves into the elevators which seem to stop on every floor to pick up ever greater numbers of these deplorables, despite the elevators being filled to capacity. The fact that these people choose to force their way into the already crowded space is a testament to their disregard for others.

I can look past the vanity and narcissism of people sitting by the pool in Audemars Piguet watches and stacks of Cartier love bracelets — and I can definitely try my best to ignore the fact that everything is so eye-wateringly expensive.

But what really rubs me the wrong way is that the experience—for all the reasons I’ve just explained—simply isn’t worth the prices I’m being charged.

I can definitely pay more at places like The Edition, Faena, W, and Ritz Carlton and have a better experience.

But I could also pay less at places like The Eden Roc, Cadillac, or The Raleigh and very possibly have a better stay…

The real tragedy here is that this beautiful hotel is slowly destroying its reputation by choosing not to enforce basic tenets of decorum and allowing a certain element of its guests to ruin the experience for others.",A few rotten apples spoils the bag

I came to this hotel as a teen. As a mid-aged adult, I wanted to love it. But so much for in the way:
- Entitled obnoxious narcissistic clientele. Expect to claw and fight your way to get a coffee, get up the elevator, or check out. Fuggetabout it regarding getting a pool chair if you’re not up and out by 8:10am, kissing up to and greasing the pool attendants with serious cash. You’ll be sitting on the lawn in direct sunlight if you don’t tip upfront and tip well, almost create a contract with the attendant that they take care of you and your family for the trip- want to feel special or feel like a loser? Bring cash and lots cause no one wants to feel less than at The Fountainbleau. Bring your best designer sunglasses, flip flops, and designer hat. Rolex and diamonds by the pool. This is how they roll. 

Plan to wait 45 minutes for the elevator with your designer luggage. Check-in and out were a nightmare. Parking is $58/night. If you’re doing an owner’s unit, $175 plus tax for housecleaning. 

Lines for the coffee, lines for a sandwich.  Water $10.  Drinks by the pool- $31 then add tip and tax. 

So much seaweed on the beach. 

If you’re not in the first row on the beach, the other chairs and umbrellas block your view of the ocean. You might as well be in Brooklyn on the asphalt, listening to your rude relatives scream at each other. 

If you want to feel special, book a suite at a 5 star boutique hotel anywhere in the world. It’ll cost you less. 

And look at your bill before or after you check out. They tried to rip me off in creative ways by reversing credited charges or adding an extra parking fee. 

Oh, and the staff are miserable. Sad faces, unhappy employees. Housekeeping walks right by loads of piled up garbage in the halls. Stacks of dirty towels sitting outside rooms for days. 

Someone’s not making this place run right. It’s all a facade. Like so many of the clientele who have no class and charge up a storm to look like they’re something they’re not. Until they get the bill. Good luck getting what you paid for, or seeing that you’re charged for things you didn’t expect. 

This iconic hotel in a beautiful setting deserves to live up to its glamour and glitz but it is a dirty scoundrel. Somebody clean up this mess and restore it so it can shine and sparkle. It’s way too expensive to be just a dusty diamond, no longer worth its weight. An influx of workers who want to work and cater to clients, who can get the job done and done well is what’s needed so vacationers can get their cappuccinos right away and get their pool chairs easily, and not go hungry, and get to their rooms, and get what they need to make their vacations go right. Otherwise, it’s stress and frustration, which is why we  needed a vacation in the first place. Calvin, take me away. And if I’m taken to the Radisson across the street, it may be a better more relaxing time! Fountainbleau- adeux to you. Wish you were my style, but you failed me.","5 star dreams, 2 star reality."

POSITIVE: 
We were able to get early check in at 11am without charge.
The Front Desk Agent was extremely nice and helpful.
Bellmen were extremely friendly.
Pool Attendants were extremely friendly.
Banquet staff was great.
Room was big with an okay view of the ocean.

NEGATIVE:
Tiniest bathroom even though we were in a 2 bedded room - impossible for 2 people to efficiently get ready.
Was never informed prior to check in or at check in that all F&B outlets charge a auto 20% gratuity.
Even though every F&B staff member knows there's an auto-gratuity, they ALL hit you with the line as if trained to do so: ""I don't receive any of that auto-gratuity so if you add more to the Tip line, I'll actually get that"" - if this is true, shame on the Hotel - if this is not true, then some major corrective training needs to be done with the staff.
Charged a nightly $40 Destination Fee but for the life of us, we couldn't figure out what was included - no robes/slippers or comp water in the room, have to pay $100-$200 for a Spa Day Pass, having an umbrella opened up at the beach or pool costs you $25++, and every time you ask for just a cup of water you're told the only option is to purchase bottled water.
Even though I paid $100 for the Spa Day Pass, half of the amenities in the Women's side (different rain showers and tubs) were out of order and the mineral pool in the co-ed area had mold all over the walls!",Corporate Retreat

Security rummaging through bags and being completely disrespectful with their words was terrible.  The running out of towels and being kicked out of the pool before sundown for private events was actually quite deceiving. Our one resort fee for the one night was refunded. The staff was all rude with the exception of the burger joint server and a few young ladies at the coffee place. For the price you pay it’s mostly maintained except the carpets are filthy in the main entrance.  There was hardly seats and if you tried to get a security would be down your throat. The only enjoyment was where there was hardly anyone on the 5th floor pool. I’ll check out another new place or stay at our usual diplomat.

Well we finally planned a vacation here and it has been nothing close to what I expected, except for some employees that have tried to help us have a better experience despite the nonstop torment we have experienced.

Our room number is not suffice they tell us because they have too many amenities available to outsiders and need to keep things secure. We have had employees remove our items off the chairs at the pool, even though we followed the 20 minute rule of returning (not 45 minutes like they told us). Then the servers ganged up on us and  wouldn’t serve us and the manager had to serve us. We left the pool due to bullying behavior and joined those being accommodating on the beach. All along they blocked our credit card, we spoke with Chase and they said Anastasia(manager) put a hold. We spoke with Brianna and she was able to help us out. I would like to compliment Justin at the beach, Antoine(we loved his ufc and sparring stories) and the manager( I don’t recall his name but he had a scar under see his eye) at the pool and several other crew members at the beach that were able to make us smile through all the nonsense we dealt with. I met another customer who dealt with a similar situation and he was going straight to the main desk to work it out. He said they took care of him which I am happy to hear because it was the first day of his stay. I can not say that they have done anything to help us out except for anxiety. It is sad that a place that has such a history and story can not uphold itself to its standards.

She told them that she is not a hotel guest but would like to have a drink at the bar. They looked at her judgingly and the security guy just said “no” in an unfriendly manner. She was just baffled and was not given any explanation as to why she cannot enter. As there were other guests waiting she did not want to make a scene and left. 

Now there is no issue about having specific hotel rules about who gets access to what.

We’ve had a couple good experiences with a great waitress at La Cote and Julian setting up chairs at the beach. Other than that, it was bad. The person checking us in blatantly lied to us about not being able to add names and only the main guest could charge to the room (we were her last customer of the day). You pay a zillion dollars for water at the little pastry shop - no hello, no thank you, literally no acknowledgement. Called the spa and they answered with only “hello” and then said we could look online ourselves for availability and if we wanted specials information we could call and they’d get back to us in 24 hours. Paid $500 for a daybed at the beach - waiter stopped by once, we had to flag the him down twice and also had to flag him down for the bill. We were out there 5 hours and that’s all we saw him! I heard a person cleaning the pool area (well before sunset which is when they say it closes) tell a kid who asked if they had clean towels out that no but “over there are the dirty ones and you can help yourself.” They ought to remove the auto-gratuity and maybe people would care about their customer service - I am happy to tip generously when I’m not getting treated like I’m annoying the person by being there.

The largest I recall staying in.  Whatever you budget for your stay there add at least 50%  Once there, everything is very expensive.  You will never think, wow, that’s reasonable. I was on the beach each day, really never sat at the pool which was always packed. The beach.  The sun is beating down.  You want an umbrella. You will be charged $26 plus tax for each umbrella for 5 minutes or all day.  The food and beverage service experience depends on the server.  One day I had a Russian young lady.  She was awesome. Next day a Venezuelan young lady, she looked frazzled but did a great job.  Then had a day with a young man.  He was not good at all.  He certainly was not stressed and just wandered around.  He forgot about my order.  One day had the hamburger sliders. I could tell they cooked frozen patty’s —raw in the middle when served.  I could not eat much of them.  The hotdogs and chicken tenders were good.  Stick with them.  If you eat your hotdogs the Chicago way, with mustard, bring some from the restaurant.  I asked for mustard each time I ordered a hotdog and never got it.  They always dumped ketchup packets in the box—never mustard. Very expensive food.  
Breakfast inside is good.  Buffet is very good as is ordering off the menu.  There is an inside coffee shop with pastries and more.  Good stuff in there.  If you want to park a car at the Fontainebleau it will cost $67 plus tax each night. Room cleaning service is good.  When checking out allow extra time.  People have checkout shock and tend to review all the charges.  

The Fontainebleau does have guest trust issues.  Once at the restaurant they took my drivers license back to the kitchen to check out.  One day on the beach they (food and beverage service) held my room pass card until I left for the day.  Other days not.  Then there were times they wanted to see my room pass card going or coming to the beach or pool area.  None of this was consistent.  Sometimes a shake down including bag inspections, other times nothing.  Once I saw a man trying to get to the pool and could not show a room pass card.  I kept going without being asked.  I don’t know what happened to the the cardless guest.  

I liked the gym.  

Disclaimer. I am an old man.  Here’s the thing.  Everywhere I saw people enjoying themselves and having a good time.  I did not see anyone over the age of 5 that was unhappy.  Yes, some kids get cranky.  Given the enormous size of the Fontainebleau, I have to say they do a good job.  This is not the Fontainebleau pre 1970.  But if you can afford it and are OK with being in a busy hotel, then I can recommend the Fontainebleau.",An enjoyable and expensive hotel

The front desk personnel were responsive and attentive. At the pool the staff was somewhat attentive although it was a very busy time. I do specifically note in ALL CAPS that one staff member at the pool was exceptional/5 stars in all categories, his name is English. Thank you English for making our stay truly great, amazing, phenomenal! Truly Hoping you’ll be here for our next visit.
La Vida restaurant was also great.
The only negative was that there was a group of unruly teenagers with no parental supervision that had to be escorted from the pools. Thank you Fontainebleau for addressing this problem quickly.",A truly great vacation at Fountainbleu!

Repeated assurances that it would be, that it had, that it will be fixed.  Not fixed.   Finally fixed 4 hours later.   3.  Fold out bed not made up.  Hours and hours and repeated requests, still not made up.  4 hours later, finally made up.  5.  15 teenagers took over the kiddie pool.  WWE wrestling, pushing past kids on slide.  Lifeguards did their best but the kids literally blocked the slide and started chanting and the lifeguards stood by unable to do anything (and to their credit they were doing everything they could with a group of very disrespectful teenagers.  Little kids were getting knocked over and no one could do anything.  Finally a group of dads had to force the kids out and block the pool.   6.  Requests for towels/umbrella at the pool, ignored.

It would be a 3 star review if it were a 4 star $500 a night type place. But given the price point (we paid $1600/night for our room) and 5 star rating, I am giving it 2. There are much better options for the price point and 5 star category in this location, in my experience (have stayed in miami beach multiple times). 

To start with the positive: The services is really good/attentive, the grounds (not rooms) and restaurants are cool/flashy/sceney, and the pool/grounds are solid (not the best in miami). It is popular for the restaurants and cool designs on the grounds and well trained staff. However overall I think there are much better luxury options in miami beach / south beach for an actual stay, if you care more about quality of rooms/actual property, location, and pool. 

Issues: 1) the rooms are not that nice. We booked a junior king suite partial ocean view room for $1600/night. The room felt like 4 star vegas with no view. Low ceilings, bones and finishing quality mediocre, cool design touches but overall not 5 star room bones. 2) the hotel is right next to another taller / bigger building that is pretty close, so 95% of the view was blocked/looking directly at that building. We were on the north side which is where half the rooms of the type we booked are, maybe the other side is better. We didnt feel like we were on the beach despite the price and description of the room, you could not see ocean unless standing at an extreme angle to the window. We asked for an upgrade because we thought the description was misleading; we were told this was normal / how the rooms were, and would have to pay significantly more to upgrade. 3) location: it isnt that close to nice restaurants other than the ones at the hotel, which are good, but there isnt much to do around the actual hotel. Options are stay on the grounds or get a 20 minute uber. Not walkable. 

Overall I would go here for dinner / drinks and stay somewhere else. One hotel (better all around, most similar from a luxury standpoint but better luxury IMO), Standard (better vibe, better pool, not as luxury, but cooler, and better location), and fountainebleau (better resort-like if that is what you want, faena is kind of resort like) are all better options in my experience. All have better views/pool, and the One and Standard are notably better locations (especially the standard; One is closer / more walkable. The FB is even further/worse location but if you dont want to leave it is better than Faena).  I think Faena gets the strong reviews more from the service (which is great and which does make people want to reciprocate with a good review) and the restaurants (they are cool but you dont need to stay here to eat here). And the unique designs/art. But actual rooms, views, location all mediocre, pool etc. fine but not standout. ",Overrated. There are better luxury options on miami beach / south beach

But after the superlative reviews and at a rather breathtaking price, I honestly was expecting something perfect.  

The pluses: the staff, the staff, the staff.  Kind and genuinely wanting to be helpful.  Also the spa - exquisite and great treatment.   The decor is as special as you would expect from the pictures you have seen.  

The minuses: my room (415) was billed as an ocean view junior suite.  However, the ocean view from such a low floor isn’t much - and the room, right on top of the spa, looks much more directly onto an events/dining area - sitting on the balcony didn’t feel private or restful at all.  While some junior suites have desk areas, this one did not - a shame as I had to work.  I asked about moving but they were undersndably fully booked.  Of course no Virtuoso upgrade available. Also, there was a crib in my room ( not requested by me) when I checked in. I asked before dinner and after dinner to have it removed. After I got tired of waiting for someone to come to get it I just moved it into the hallway myself. Not a big deal but not perfect service either.  These things aren’t tragedies but at more than 2700/night w fees and taxes ….. you do want better. 

Minor quibbles with the room had to do with electricity: the outlet for the coffee maker was broken and although engineering was called, it wasn’t fixed. And the light switches could drive you crazy trying to get the lights to actually turn off.  Japanese toilet is a great touch though.

Food and beverage; dinner at Los Fuegos and breakfast were great service.   Nothing that memorable food wise but nothing was bad either.   The steak at Los Fuegos was good but the appetizer was bland - same w breakfast dishes.  The pool and beach food service is great but the food not that exciting. Go to the pool early if you want an umbrella. By 11:30 AM you could still get a lounger, but nothing shaded.

I will probably come back because of the service. I think I will book a lower room category that is less expensive , so I am less disappointed!",Very good  but not perfect

The fabulous Faena is the perfect choice for our special family vacation-not only the most architecturally gorgeous hotel, but also so well situated in South Beach. 
A few weeks ago I began arranging a special event for my family, needing 2 room accommodations, which I was quickly overwhelmed with planning the details of this perfect event. Raul Diaz a Reservation's Specialist was so kind and caring, took the time to coordinate every details with me and in a carefully detailed email outlined everything that we had discussed. I contacted Raul several times to make minor changes and every time, including bringing family pet and he was beyond kind, responsive and professional. He really understood that this was a special occasion for us as a family and never gave the impression that I was taking too much of his time. The five stars got to Raul for making us feel special and tending to our every need.  We all are beyond excited for this experience.  Thank again to Raul !

They have a fantastic staff from right when you walk in the door, that have such excellent manners and energy!! I went to the second show this time called ALLURA and it was so an extravagant and exciting experience to be a part of.  It is not your typical night in Miami Beach which makes it brilliant! So, if you're looking for a one-of-a-kind, liberating, exotic type of night, then you should definitely come here and support the lovely cast!  I came to support my lovely friend Alana and her husband who have such heart-touching and intimate sets together that touch your soul. Alana is extremely talented as well as the rest of the team and I cannot wait to visit again and again and AGAIN!  Every time I come I have a fantastic experience.

Hotel is right on the beach and is how you would expect a  ‘cool’ Miami Beach hotel to be. “in” crowd, Art Deco type building, swanky interior (which may or may not be your taste).

Staff was friendly, beach nice, room spacious and clean. Food was very nice throughout the hotel.

Also would like to point out that they have a nice outdoor bar area for pre dinner drinks and an a busy indoor bar for later boasting live music - really a great plus.

Minor cons: 
- some of the room features & furnitures soemwhat dated (eg scratches, dents, spots) even though room was very clean.
- valet can be soemwhat disorganized so plan in advance if you need your car urgently

All in all a good experience, would not mind staying here again but also might check out another place next time round.",“Cool” Miami Beach Hotel

I said yes.

Maybe it was because there was a massive boat show in town. Either way, we got suckered into paying $2,500/night for three nights at the Faena, so we we expected opulence.  What we got was a ripoff at a $400/night hotel. 
The location is excellent, right on a private beach. That’s the only positive of this review. Here’s the abundant negatives:
* it was a windy day at the beach, so we asked for a canopy. We were told they were all reserved. There were only six of them. For an entire hotel. So we instead sat on the windy beach and enjoyed a $20 pina colada in a pre-packaged coconut.
* so we went to the pool. You can’t just sit down, they find you a seat. But we were told all the lounges were reserved, even the empty ones that go with the cabanas, and the cabanas were all reserved. Come back in an hour, we were told.
* our room, which was exceedingly average, smelled like mildew. They sent housekeeping with some sprays. The room was also quite dark, and the lights didn’t go up any higher.
* as for Miami Beach, it’s nice. There’s a long walkway that I went on for a mile or so, seeing where it led. Turns out it didn’t lead anywhere. There’s not much to do here other than beach and restaurants. 
* there’s some fun art, including gold wooly mammoth bones. But the glass case is cracked, and, like the rest of this hotel, the display seems old and neglected.
And that, dear reader, all happened within 24 hours. Because after the pool fiasco, we up and left the Faena for greener pastures — the reliable Four Seasons in the Brickell section of Miami, which was wonderful (see my review of that wonderful hotel for details). The Faena was nice enough to cancel our second and third nights, and we paid less than half at a way better hotel. Do yourself a favor. Skip this aging monolith.",BEWARE: Do not overpay!
